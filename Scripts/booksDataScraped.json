            "authorName": "Emily Anthes",
            "description": "An Architectural Record Notable Book\n\nA fascinating, thought-provoking journey into our built environment\n\nModern humans are an indoor species. We spend 90 percent of our time inside, shuttling between homes and offices, schools and stores, restaurants and gyms. And yet, in many ways, the indoor world remains unexplored territory. For all the time we spend inside buildings, we rarely stop to consider: How do these spaces affect our mental and physical well-being? Our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors? Our productivity, performance, and relationships?\n\nIn this wide-ranging, character-driven book, science journalist Emily Anthes takes us on an adventure into the buildings in which we spend our days, exploring the profound, and sometimes unexpected, ways that they shape our lives. Drawing on cutting-edge research, she probes the pain-killing power of a well-placed window and examines how the right office layout can expand our social networks. She investigates how room temperature regulates our cognitive performance, how the microbes hiding in our homes influence our immune systems, and how cafeteria design affects what--and how much--we eat.\n\nAlong the way, Anthes takes readers into an operating room designed to minimize medical errors, a school designed to boost students' physical fitness, and a prison designed to support inmates' psychological needs. And she previews the homes of the future, from the high-tech houses that could monitor our health to the 3D-printed structures that might allow us to live on the Moon.\n\nThe Great Indoors provides a fresh perspective on our most familiar surroundings and a new understanding of the power of architecture and design. It's an argument for thoughtful interventions into the built environment and a story about how to build a better world--one room at a time.\n\n\nAbout the Author: Emily Anthes is an award-winning science journalist and author. Her work has appeared in The New York Times, The New Yorker, The Atlantic, Wired, Nature, Slate, Businessweek, Scientific American, The Washington Post, The Boston Globe, and elsewhere. Her previous book, Frankenstein's Cat, was long-listed for the PEN/E. O. Wilson Literary Science Writing Award.",

            "description": "Reinforced concrete is the most widely used construction material in the world, and extended performance is rightly expected. Many structures are in aggressive environments, of critical importance and may be irreplaceable, so repair and protection are vital. This book surveys deterioration of concrete, particularly corrosion of the steel reinforcement, and the various chemical, biological, physical and mechanical causes of deterioration. It outlines condition survey and diagnosis techniques by on-site and laboratory measurements. It sets out mechanical methods of protection and repair, such as patching, inhibitors, coatings, penetrants and structural strengthening as well as cathodic protection and other electrochemical methods. This book also gives guidance on preventative measures including concrete technology and construction considerations, coatings and penetrants, alternate reinforcement, permanent corrosion monitoring and durability planning aspects.\n\nAsset managers, port engineers, bridge maintenance managers, building managers, heritage structure engineers, plant engineers, consulting engineers, architects, specialist contractors and construction material suppliers who have the task of resolving problems of corrosion of steel reinforced concrete elements will find this book an extremely useful resource. It will also be a valuable reference for students at postgraduate level.\n\nAuthors\n\nThe late Professor Brian Cherry of Monash University, Melbourne, Australia was one of the world's leading corrosion science and engineering educators and researchers.\n\nWarren Green of Vinsi Partners, Sydney, Australia is a corrosion engineer and materials scientist.

            "description": "For everyone interested in the enduring appeal of Louis Kahn, this book demonstrates that a close look at how Kahn put his buildings together will reveal a deeply felt philosophy.\n\nLouis I. Kahn is one of the most influential and poetic architects of the twentieth century, a figure whose appeal extends beyond the realm of specialists. In this book, noted Kahn expert John Lobell explores how Kahn's focus on structure, respect for materials, clarity of program, and reverence for details come together to manifest an overall philosophy. Kahn's work clearly conveys a kind of transcendent rootedness--a rootedness in the fundamentals of architecture that also asks soaring questions about our experience of light and space, and even how we fit into the world. In Louis Kahn: Architecture as Philosophy, John Lobell seeks to reveal how Kahn's buildings speak to grand humanistic concerns.\nThrough examinations of five of Kahn's great buildings--the Richards Medical Research Building in Philadelphia; the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla; the Phillips Exeter Academy Library in New Hampshire; the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth; and the Yale Center for British Art in New Haven--Lobell presents a clear but detailed look at how the way these buildings are put together presents Kahn's philosophy, including how Kahn wishes us to experience them. An architecture book that touches on topics that addresses the universal human interests of consciousness and creativity, Louis Kahn: Architecture as Philosophy helps us understand our place and the nature of well-being in the built environment.\nAbout the Author: John Lobell is a researcher, instructor, and lecturer on the subjects of architecture, creativity, and consciousness. A professor of architecture at Pratt Institute, Brooklyn, since 1980, he has lectured widely and is the author of numerous articles. He has studied and worked with major creative and cultural figures of the twentieth century, including mythologist Joseph Campbell; architects Louis Kahn and Robert Venturi; Buddhist masters Chogyam Trungpa, Robert Thurman, and the Dalai Lama; and Tai Chi master Cheng Man-Ch'ing.\nHis previous books include Between Silence and Light: Spirit in the Architecture of Louis I. Kahn (Shambhala, 1979/2008), which has sold 25,000 copies across two editions, Joseph Campbell: The Man and His Ideas (1993), and Visionary Creativity (2015).",

            "authorName": "Janis Tomlinson",
            "description": "The first major English-language biography of Francisco Goya y Lucientes, who ushered in the modern era\n\nThe life of Francisco Goya (1746-1828) coincided with an age of transformation in Spanish history that brought upheavals in the country's politics and at the court which Goya served, changes in society, the devastation of the Iberian Peninsula in the war against Napoleon, and an ensuing period of political instability. In this revelatory biography, Janis Tomlinson draws on a wide range of documents--including letters, court papers, and a sketchbook used by Goya in the early years of his career--to provide a nuanced portrait of a complex and multifaceted painter and printmaker, whose art is synonymous with compelling images of the people, events, and social revolution that defined his life and era.\n\nTomlinson challenges the popular image of the artist as an isolated figure obsessed with darkness and death, showing how Goya's likeability and ambition contributed to his success at court, and offering new perspectives on his youth, rich family life, extensive travels, and lifelong friendships. She explores the full breadth of his imagery--from scenes inspired by life in Madrid to visions of worlds without reason, from royal portraits to the atrocities of war. She sheds light on the artist's personal trials, including the deaths of six children and the onset of deafness in middle age, but also reconsiders the conventional interpretation of Goya's late years as a period of disillusion, viewing them instead as years of liberated artistic invention, most famously in the murals on the walls of his country house, popularly known as the black paintings.\n\nA monumental achievement, Goya: A Portrait of the Artist is the definitive biography of an artist whose faith in his art and his genius inspired paintings, drawings, prints, and frescoes that continue to captivate, challenge, and surprise us two centuries later.\n\n\nAbout the Author: Janis A. Tomlinson has written and lectured extensively on the art of Goya. Her books include Goya: Order and Disorder, Goya: Images of Women, Goya in the Twilight of Enlightenment, and Francisco Goya: The Tapestry Cartoons and Early Career at the Court of Madrid.",

            "authorName": "Victoria Lautman",
            "description": "Some of the finest architectural structures in India are to be found below ground: these are its ancient stepwells. Stepwells are unique to India; the earliest rudimentary wells date from about the 4th century CE, and eventually they were built throughout the country, particularly in the arid western regions. Stepwell construction evolved so that, by the 11th century, they were amazingly complex feats of architecture and engineering, not only providing water all year round but also serving as gathering places, refuges and retreats.\n\nThe journalist Victoria Lautman first encountered stepwells three decades ago, and this book - now available in paperback for the first time - is a testament to her determined efforts over several years to document these fascinating but largely unknown structures before they disappear. Of the thousands of stepwells that proliferated across India, most were abandoned as a result of modernization and the depletion of water tables. Frequently commissioned by royal or wealthy patrons, the wells vary greatly in scale and design. Some also functioned as subterranean Hindu temples, featuring columned pavilions and elaborate stone carvings. Islamic wells were generally less flamboyant, but often incorporated shady loggias and small chambers in which to relax and escape the stifling heat. Today, few stepwells are in use. The majority have been left to silt up, fill with rubbish and crumble into disrepair. Gradually, however, the Indian government and heritage organizations are recognizing the need to preserve these architectural wonders. In 2014 India's grandest and best-known stepwell, the Rani ki Vav in Patan, Gujarat, became a UNESCO World Heritage site.\n\nIn her introduction, Lautman discusses why and where the stepwells were built. She reflects on the reasons they became derelict and considers how the appreciation of stepwells is changing with the work of organizations and individuals who aim to protect and restore them. The main part of the book is arranged in a broadly chronological order, with up to four pages devoted to each of c. 70 stepwells, every one unique in design and engineering.

            "description": "In his major new history, Paul Greenhalgh tells the story of ceramics as a story of human civilisation, from the Ancient Greeks to the present day. As a core craft technology, pottery has underpinned domesticity, business, religion, recreation, architecture, and art for millennia. Indeed, the history of ceramics parallels the development of human society.\n\nThis fascinating and very human history traces the story of ceramic art and industry from the Ancient Greeks to the Romans and the medieval world; Islamic ceramic cultures and their influence on the Italian Renaissance; Chinese and European porcelain production; modernity and Art Nouveau; the rise of the studio potter, Art Deco, International Style and Mid-Century Modern, and finally, the contemporary explosion of ceramic making and the postmodern potter. Interwoven in this journey through time and place is the story of the pots themselves, the culture of the ceramics, and their character and meaning. Ceramics have had a presence in virtually every country and historical period, and have worked as a commodity servicing every social class. They are omnipresent: a ubiquitous art. Ceramic culture is a clear, unique, definable thing, and has an internal logic that holds it together through millennia. Hence ceramics is the most peculiar and extraordinary of all the arts. At once cheap, expensive, elite, plebeian, high-tech, low-tech, exotic, eccentric, comic, tragic, spiritual, and secular, it has revealed itself to be as fluid as the mud it is made from.\n\nCeramics are the very stuff of how civilized life was, and is, led. This then is the story of human society's most surprising core causes and effects.\n\n\nAbout the Author: Paul Greenhalgh is Director of the Sainsbury Centre and Professor of Art History and Museum Strategy at the University of East Anglia, UK. He was previously Head of Research at the V&A Museum, London, and is the author of books including The Persistence of Craft (2002) and Art Nouveau (2000).",

            "description": "Depicts 385 miniature paintings of the Gita by Allah Baksh, from late 17th century Mewar, published for the first time Features fine translations of the Gita from Mewari into Hindi by Chandra Prakash Deval and thereafter into English by Alok Bhalla Includes richly nuanced and imaginative commentary by Alok Bhalla on each of the paintings, which reveals that each image is a unique moment of revelation The miniature paintings of the Gita by Allah Baksh, published in this volume for the first time, are from the late 17th century Mewar. Commissioned by Udaipur's Maharana Jai Singh, these paintings of the Gita are part of an illustrated Mahabharata folio of more than 4,000 works. Allah Baksh's luminous work on the Gita has no precedent in India's art tradition. He has illustrated Krishna's ecstatic song, verse by abstract verse. His images, meditative and unostentatious, are free from both heroic posturing and spiritual pride. Their colors are clear and luminous; their lines are restrained and precise. The folio reveals an artist for whom the Gita is a magnificent conversation between man and God about the pity and the sorrow of war. Alok Bhalla's commentary on the relationship between the paintings and the verses of the Gita is richly nuanced and imaginative. He challenges us to think about how artists have interpreted India's sacred texts in radically new ways. Bhalla argues that these miniature paintings are not mere illustrations of Krishna's divine discourse and that Allah Baksh's work is a morally significant visual guide to the Gita, as each painting is a unique moment of revelation. Chandra Prakash Deval's fine translation of the Gita from Mewari into Hindi is a valuable addition to our understanding of the history of cultural exchange between the different regions and languages of India.\nAbout the Author: Alok Bhalla is a widely published critic, translator and poet. He has taught in various universities in the US and India, and has held Fellowships from different academic institutes in France, Italy, England, Germany, Canada and Israel. His books include Stories about the Partition of India (4 volumes), Partition Dialogues, Shades of the Preternatural (on Gothic fiction), The Politics of Atrocity and Lust (on the Vampire tale) and The Life and Times of Saadat Hasan Manto. He has also co-edited and translated Intizar Husain's A Chronicle of the Peacocks, Day and Dastan and Story is a Vagabond. His verse translation of Dharamvir Bharati's play, Andha Yug, is a recognized classic. Chandra Prakash Deval is an eminent poet, fiction writer, translator, bibliophile, and cultural historian, he has published 14 collections of poetry in Hindi and Rajasthani. He has been the recipient of many prestigious literary awards like the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1979 for his poetry collection, Paagi, and the Bihari Puruskar for Hirna! Maun Saadh Van Charana in 2013. The Government of India bestowed the Padma Shri on him in recognition of his contributions to literature in 2011.",

The title story in this collection is about feeling trapped by other people's definitions of who we are. The Bear-man finds love in the beautiful and compassionate Rain-maiden but thinks he would never be good enough for her. He concludes that if he reveals his true feelings she would ridicule him like everyone in his life has always done. He grows gruff and antisocial, believing that he could never find friendship--least of all, love.\n\nThe other stories in this collection represent oral narratives from the people of Nagaland in northeast India, stories shared privately around a glowing hearth--spirit stories that the narrators swear are true encounters. While \"Forest Song,\" \"New Road,\" \"River and Earth Story,\" and \"The Man Who Lost His Spirit\" were narrated to the author by local storytellers, \"The Man Who Went to Heaven\" and \"One Day\" are entirely based on Naga folktales. \"The Weretigerman,\" meanwhile, is woven around the pre-Christian Naga tradition of certain men becoming dual-souled with the tiger.\n\nIn these stories, illustrated in full color by graphic artist Sunandini Banerjee, Kire brings Nagaland come alive with her rich portrayal of both the natural and the spiritual world, which, to the Naga mind, harmoniously coexisted until the recent past.\n\nAbout the Author: Easterine Kire is a poet and novelist who has written several books, including A Quiet Matriarchy, Bitter Wormwood, A Respectable Woman, and When the River Sleeps. Sunandini Banerjee is a Calcutta-based graphic artist and editor who has illustrated books by Thomas Bernhard, Yves Bonnefoy, Ivan Vladislavic and Cees Nooteboom, among others.\n",

Since the establishment of the haveli (temple mansion) in 1671, artists have flocked to the sacred town to adorn the walls where Shrinathji dwells with painted cloth hangings as well as to provide painted icons for the pilgrimage trade. At one time there were hundreds of artists in the service of Shrinathji. This catalog explores Anil Relia's comprehensive collection of Nathdwara paintings and sketches, celebrating the wide-ranging talents of various artists. The painters are creators of icons and storytellers of Krishna's exploits. Krishna lives in their everyday lives permeating their thoughts and guiding their brushes. At the same time, they record important events in temple history and portraits of the people who participated in these affairs. The paintings that document festivals adhere to a traditional hieratic style, but the artist displays a freer hand in telling the exploits of Krishna. A prominent artist showcased in this collection is Ghasiram Hardev Sharma, a master draughtsman with a penchant for naturalism. He influenced a whole generation of 20th-century artists and is still held in high esteem.\nAbout the Author: Kalyan Krishna was Professor and Head of the Department of History of Art at Banaras Hindu University (BHU). His Ph.D. was on Mughal Painting of the Akbar Period from BHU.

Among the major publications that he has co-authored are Indian Costumes in the Collection of the Calico Museum of Textiles and Gates of the Lord: The Tradition of Krishna Painting.

For years, she had sensed something was wrong. Harry was losing weight and losing friends. He had lost the brightness in his eyes and voice, changing from a young boy with boundless enthusiasm to a shadow of himself, chasing something she could not see. Now her worst fears had come to light.\n\nUnder Our Roof is the story of a national crisis suffered in the intimacy of so many homes, told with incredible candor through the dual perspectives of a mother rising in politics and a son living a double life, afraid of what might happen if his secret is exposed. In this honest, bracing, yet ultimately uplifting memoir, they discuss the patterns of a family dealing with an unspoken disease, the fear that keeps addicts hiding in shame, and the moments of honesty, faith, and personal insight that led to Harry's recovery.\n\nIn a country searching for answers to the devastating effects of opioids and drug abuse, Under Our Roof is a ray of hope in the darkness. It is not only a love story between mother and son but also an honest account of a pressing national crisis by a family poised to make a difference.\nAbout the Author: Madeleine Dean is the congresswoman for the Fourth District of Pennsylvania, suburban Philadelphia, a member of the House Judiciary and House Financial Services committees, and vice chair of the bipartisan Women's Caucus.

Factory Summers chronicles the daily rhythms of life in the mill, and the twelve hour shifts he spent in a hot, noisy building filled with arcane machinery. Delisle takes his noted outsider perspective and applies it domestically, this time as a boy amongst men through the universal rite of passage of the summer job. Even as a teenager, Delisle's keen eye for hypocrisy highlights the tensions of class and the rampant sexism an all-male workplace permits.\n\nGuy works the floor doing physically strenuous tasks. He is one of the few young people on site, and furthermore gets the job through his father's connections, a fact which rightfully earns him disdain from the lifers. Guy's dad spends his whole career in the white collar offices, working 9 to 5 instead of the rigorous 12-hour shifts of the unionized labor. Guy and his dad aren't close, and Factory Summers leaves Delisle reconciling whether the job led to his dad's aloofness and unhappiness.\n\nOn his days off, Guy finds refuge in art, a world far beyond the factory floor. Delisle shows himself rediscovering comics at the public library, and preparing for animation school-only to be told on the first day, \"There are no jobs in animation.\" Eager to pursue a job he enjoys, Guy throws caution to the wind.\n\n\nAbout the Author: Born in Québec City, Canada, in 1966, Guy Delisle now lives in the South of France with his wife and two children. Delisle spent ten years working in animation and is best known for his travelogues about life in faraway countries. He is the author of numerous graphic novels and travelogues, including Hostage, Jerusalem: Chronicles from the Holy City and Pyongyang: A Journey in North Korea. In 2012, Guy Delisle was awarded the Prize for Best Album for the French edition of Jerusalem at the Angoulême International Comics Festival.",

Stewart\n\n\"An outstanding biography . . . [George Washington] has a narrative drive such a life deserves.\"--The Wall Street Journal\n\nWashington's rise constitutes one of the greatest self-reinventions in history. In his mid-twenties, this third son of a modest Virginia planter had ruined his own military career thanks to an outrageous ego. But by his mid-forties, that headstrong, unwise young man had evolved into an unassailable leader chosen as the commander in chief of the fledgling Continental Army. By his mid-fifties, he was unanimously elected the nation's first president. How did Washington emerge from the wilderness to become the central founder of the United States of America?\n\nIn this remarkable new portrait, award-winning historian David O. Stewart unveils the political education that made Washington a master politician--and America's most essential leader. From Virginia's House of Burgesses, where Washington mastered the craft and timing of a practicing politician, to his management of local government as a justice of the Fairfax County Court to his eventual role in the Second Continental Congress and his grueling generalship in the American Revolution, Washington perfected the art of governing and service, earned trust, and built bridges. The lessons in leadership he absorbed along the way would be invaluable during the early years of the republic as he fought to unify the new nation.\nAbout the Author: David O. Stewart turned to writing after a career practicing law in Washington, DC, defending accused criminals and challenging government actions as unconstitutional. He is a national bestselling and award-winning author of four previous books on American history. He is formerly the president of the Washington Independent Review of Books.",

            "authorName": "Alexander Larman",
            "description": "The thrilling and definitive account of the Abdication Crisis of 1936\n\nOn December 10, 1936, King Edward VIII brought a great international drama to a close when he abdicated, renouncing the throne of the United Kingdom for himself and his heirs. The reason he gave when addressing his subjects was that he could not fulfill his duties without the woman he loved--the notorious American divorcee Wallis Simpson--by his side. His actions scandalized the establishment, who were desperate to avoid an international embarrassment at a time when war seemed imminent. That the King was rumored to have Nazi sympathies only strengthened their determination that he should be forced off the throne, by any means necessary.\n\nAlexander Larman's The Crown in Crisis will treat readers to a new, thrilling view of this legendary story. Informed by revelatory archival material never-before-seen, as well as by interviews with many of Edward's and Wallis's close friends, Larman creates an hour-by-hour, day-by-day suspenseful narrative that brings readers up to the point where the microphone is turned on and the king speaks to his subjects. As well as focusing on King Edward and Mrs. Simpson, Larman looks closely at the roles played by those that stood against him: Prime minister Stanley Baldwin, his private secretary Alec Hardinge, and the Archbishop of Canterbury Cosmo Lang. Larman also takes the full measure of those who supported him: the great politician Winston Churchill, Machiavellian newspaper owner Lord Beaverbrook, and the brilliant lawyer Walter Monckton.\n\nFor the first time in a book about the abdication, readers will read an in-depth account of the assassination attempt on Edward's life and its consequences, a first-person chronicle of Wallis Simpson's scandalous divorce proceedings, information from the Royal Archives about the government's worries about Edward's relationship with Nazi high-command Ribbentrop and a boots-on-the-ground view of how the British people saw Edward as they watched the drama unfold. You won't be able to put down The Crown in Crisis, a full panorama of the people and the times surrounding Edward and the woman he loved.\n\n\nAbout the Author: Alexander Larman is a British historian and journalist. His acclaimed books of historical and literary biography include Blazing Star, Restoration, and Byron's Women, and he has edited and ghostwritten for a variety of publications. He writes for the Times, Observer, and Telegraph, as well as The Spectator and The Critic. He lives in Oxford with his wife Nancy and daughter Rose.",

            "description": "New York Times bestselling author Anne Sebba's moving biography of Ethel Rosenberg, the wife and mother whose execution for espionage-related crimes defined the Cold War and horrified the world.\n\nIn June 1953, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple with two young sons, were led separately from their prison cells on Death Row and electrocuted moments apart. Both had been convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union, despite the fact that the US government was aware that the evidence against Ethel was shaky at best and based on the perjury of her own brother.\n\nThis book is the first to focus on one half of that couple for more than thirty years, and much new evidence has surfaced since then. Ethel was a bright girl who might have fulfilled her personal dream of becoming an opera singer, but instead found herself struggling with the social mores of the 1950's. She longed to be a good wife and perfect mother, while battling the political paranoia of the McCarthy era, anti-Semitism, misogyny, and a mother who never valued her. Because of her profound love for and loyalty to her husband, she refused to incriminate him, despite government pressure on her to do so. Instead, she courageously faced the death penalty for a crime she hadn't committed, orphaning her children.\n\nSeventy years after her trial, this is the first time Ethel's story has been told with the full use of the dramatic and tragic prison letters she exchanged with her husband, her lawyer and her psychotherapist over a three-year period, two of them in solitary confinement. Hers is the resonant story of what happens when a government motivated by fear tramples on the rights of its citizens.\n\n\nAbout the Author: ANNE SEBBA is a prize-winning biographer, lecturer, and former Reuters foreign correspondent who has written several books, including That Woman and Les Parisiennes.

But who was Barbara Pym and why was the life of this English writer - one of the greatest chroniclers of the human heart - so defined by rejection, both in her writing and in love?\n\nPym lived through extraordinary times. She attended Oxford in the thirties when women were the minority. She spent time in Nazi Germany, falling for a man who was close to Hitler. She made a career on the Home Front as a single working girl in London's bedsit land. Through all of this, she wrote. Diaries, notes, letters, stories and more than a dozen novels - which as Byrne shows more often than not reflected the themes of Pym's own experience: worlds of spinster sisters and academics in unrequited love, of powerful intimacies that pulled together seemingly humble lives.\n\nPaula Byrne's new biography is the first to make full use of Barbara Pym's archive. Brimming with new extracts from Pym's diaries, letters and novels, this book is a joyous introduction to a woman who was herself the very best of company.\n\nByrne brings Barbara Pym back to centre stage as one of the great English novelists: a generous, shrewdly perceptive writer and a brave woman, who only in the last years of her life was suddenly, resoundingly recognised for her genius.\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nPaula Byrne is the author the bestselling biographies Perdita, Mad World, The Real Jane Austen, Belle, Kick and The Genius of Jane Austen. She is founder and chief executive of ReLit, the Bibliotherapy Foundation, a charity devoted to the mental health benefits of reading. She is married to Sir Jonathan Bate.",

            "description": "'A wonderfully assured and utterly riveting biography that captures not only the much-maligned Machiavelli, but also the spirit of his time and place. A monumental achievement.' - Jessie Childs, author of God's Traitors.\n\n'A notorious fiend', 'generally odious', 'he seems hideous, and so he is.'\n\nThanks to the invidious reputation of his most famous work, The Prince, Niccolò Machiavelli exerts a unique hold over the popular imagination. But was Machiavelli as sinister as he is often thought to be? Might he not have been an infinitely more sympathetic figure, prone to political missteps, professional failures and personal dramas?\n\nAlexander Lee reveals the man behind the myth, following him from cradle to grave, from his father's penury and the abuse he suffered at a teacher's hands, to his marriage and his many affairs (with both men and women), to his political triumphs and, ultimately, his fall from grace and exile. In doing so, Lee uncovers hitherto unobserved connections between Machiavelli's life and thought. He also reveals the world through which Machiavelli moved: from the great halls of Renaissance Florence to the court of the Borgia pope, Alexander VI, from the dungeons of the Stinche prison to the Rucellai gardens, where he would begin work on some of his last great works.\n\nAs much a portrait of an age as of a uniquely engaging man, Lee's gripping and definitive biography takes the reader into Machiavelli's world - and his work - more completely than ever before.\n\n\nAbout the Author: Alexander Lee is a research fellow at the University of Warwick. He is the author of four acclaimed books, including The Ugly Renaissance: Sex, Greed, Violence and Depravity in an Age of Beauty (a Times Literary Supplement Book of the Year) and Humanism and Empire: The Imperial Ideal in Fourteenth-Century Italy. He writes a regular column for History Today, and has contributed articles on a wide variety of historical and cultural subjects to the Sunday Telegraph, the Wall Street Journal, the Guardian, the New Statesman, the Times Literary Supplement, and Dissent, and has frequently appeared on BBC television and radio, ITV, Central Television and Sky News.

BEAR GRYLLS\n\n'From reading this book, the message that comes shining through is this: you can achieve anything.' ANT MIDDLETON\n\nBestselling author and award-winning adventurer Ross Edgley has been studying the art of resilience for years, applying all he has learned to become the first person in history to swim around Great Britain, breaking multiple world records. Now Ross focuses on mental strength, stoicism and the training needed to create an unbreakable body.\n\nRoss Edgley famously ran a marathon pulling a 1.4-tonne car and climbed a rope the height of Everest (8,848m), after living with Yamabushi warrior monks in Japan and partaking in Shamanic pain rituals with fire ants in the Amazon jungle. On his epic 1,780-mile journey around Great Britain, which lasted 157 days, Ross swam through giant jellyfish, arctic storms, 'haunted' whirlpools and polluted shipping lanes, going so hard, and so fast, his tongue fell apart.\n\nRoss's previous book, The World's Fittest Book, was a Sunday Times bestseller and explored the science of physical fitness. Now, in The Art of Resilience, Ross uses his swim experience and other amazing endurance feats, where he managed to overcome seemingly insurmountable pain, hardship and adversity, to study the performance of extreme athletes, military and fitness specialists and psychologists to uncover the secrets of mental fitness and explore the concept of resilience, persistence, valour and a disciplined mindset in overcoming adversity. This ground-breaking book represents a paradigm shift in what we thought the human body and mind were capable of and will give you a blueprint to become a tougher, more resilient and ultimately better human - whatever the challenge you face.\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nRoss Edgley is a bestselling author, award-winning adventurer and leading international expert on resilience. He is also the author of the Sunday Times bestseller The World's Fittest Book and is renowned for his gruelling athletic adventures, the most recent of which saw him become the first swimmer ever to circumnavigate mainland Britain.",

            "authorName": "Richard Heath",
            "description": "Reveals how the number science found in ancient sacred monuments reflects wisdom transmitted from the angelic orders\n\n- Explains how the angels transmitted megalithic science to early humans to further our conscious development\n\n- Decodes the angelic science hidden in a wide range of monuments, including Carnac in Brittany, the Great Pyramid in Egypt, early Christian pavements, the Hagia Sophia in Istanbul, Stonehenge in England, and the Kaaba in Mecca\n\n- Explores how the number science behind ancient monuments gave rise to religions and spiritual practices\n\nThe angelic mind is founded on a deep understanding of number and the patterns they produce. These patterns provided a constructive framework for all manifested life on Earth. The beauty and elegance we see in sacred geometry and in structures built according to those proportions are the language of the angels still speaking to us.\n\nExamining the angelic science of number first manifested on Earth in the Stone Age, Richard Heath reveals how the resulting development of human consciousness was no accident: just as the angels helped create the Earth's environment, humans were then evolved to make the planet self-aware. To develop human minds, the angels transmitted their own wisdom to humanity through a numerical astronomy that counted planetary and lunar time periods. Heath explores how this early humanity developed an expert understanding of sacred number through astronomical geometries, leading to the unified range of measures employed in their observatories and later in cosmological monuments such as the Giza Pyramids and Stonehenge. The ancient Near East transformed megalithic science into our own mathematics of notational arithmetic and trigonometry, further developing the human mind within the early civilizations.\n\nHeath decodes the angelic science hidden within a wide range of monuments and sites, including Carnac in Brittany, the Great Pyramid in Egypt, Teotihuacan in Mexico, early Christian pavements, the Hagia Sophia in Istanbul, and the Kaaba in Mecca. Exploring the techniques used to design these monuments, he explains how the number science behind them gave rise to ancient religions and spiritual practices. He also explores the importance of lunar astronomy, first in defining a world suitable for life and then in providing a subject accessible to pre-arithmetic humans, for whom the Moon was a constant companion.\nAbout the Author: Richard Heath, M.Sc., is a system designer who studies the technical achievements of the ancient world, from those of the megalithic astronomers to sacred building design. He is the author of 5 books, including Sacred Number and the Origins of Civilization and The Harmonic Origins of the World. He lives near Cardigan in Wales.",

For Jungian psychoanalyst Lisa Marchiano, this journey is not just an adventure of diaper bags and parent-teacher conferences, but one of intense self-discovery.\n\nIn Motherhood, Marchiano draws from a deep well of Jungian analysis and symbolic research to present a collection of fairy tales, myths, and fables that evoke the spiritual arc of raising a child from infancy through adulthood. After all, this kind of storytelling has always been one of the most important conduits of humanity's collective wisdom--and Marchiano provides each tale alongside keen insights into the timeless archetypes they represent.\n\nBalanced with real-life case stories from Lisa's own practice and in-depth questions for personal reflection, Motherhood explores how events like pregnancy, the calamities of childhood, and the empty-nest experience are invitations to an adventure into the wild frontier of your own soul. Here you will discover:\n\n- How the challenges of motherhood send you on journeys into your innermost source\n- Seeing the value of conflict with your child even while working to solve it\n- \"The dark passage\" of confronting and dispelling the energy of childhood wounds\n- \"The thirteenth fairy\"--how to recognize when we are resisting inconvenient or uncomfortable truths\n- Understanding how anger, rage, and aggression arise in parental relationships\n- Recognizing the ways that you have been taught to ignore your deepest instincts\n- How to navigate the inevitable periods of grief that accompany your child's many life changes\n- Why much of successful mothering requires surrendering your sense of control\n\nWith Lisa's gentle but straightforward guidance, you'll return from this inner journey in possession of the treasured knowledge needed to clarify your values, embrace your disowned parts, and claim the mantle of motherhood in the full bloom of your empowerment.\n\n\nAbout the Author: Lisa Marchiano, LCSW, is a clinical social worker, certified Jungian analyst, and a nationally certified psychoanalyst.

Alan Steinfeld, contributes and curates the collection with 30 years of experience with the subject. The Foreword by George Noory of Coast to Coast AM kicks off the volume with his veteran overview of the need to wake up to the \"new realities of extraterrestrial existence.\"\n\nAt this critical juncture in the government's official acknowledgement of the reality of UFOs/UAPs, scientists, politicians and mainstream news outlets have no idea what to make of these startling revelations or the outpouring of sightings and \"contact\" experiences currently being reported on a global scale. The book stands as the most comprehensive clarification to date on the intent and intelligence behind the phenomena. The variety of viewpoints expressed in the volume provide a solid foundation for the \"preparation\" of the greatest challenge to ever face humankind.\n\nMaking Contact stands as the essential handbook for embracing the most exalted moment in history: Meeting the cosmic others.\n\n\nAbout the Author: Alan Steinfeld is an explorer of consciousness.

            "description": "This is a textbook for the standard undergraduate econometrics course. Its only prerequisites are a semester course in statistics and one in differential calculus. Arthur Goldberger, an outstanding researcher and teacher of econometrics, views the subject as a tool of empirical inquiry rather than as a collection of arcane procedures. The central issue in such inquiry is how one variable is related to one or more others. Goldberger takes this to mean How does the average value of one variable vary with one or more others? and so takes the population conditional mean function as the target of empirical research.\n\nThe structure of the book is similar to that of Goldberger's graduate-level textbook, A Course in Econometrics, but the new book is richer in empirical material, makes no use of matrix algebra, and is primarily discursive in style. A great strength is that it is both intuitive and formal, with ideas and methods building on one another until the text presents fairly complicated ideas and proofs that are often avoided in undergraduate econometrics.\n\nTo help students master the tools of econometrics, Goldberger provides many theoretical and empirical exercises and real micro-and macroeconomic data sets. The data sets, available for download at www.hup.harvard.edu/features/golint/, deal with earnings and education, money demand, firm investment, stock prices, compensation and productivity, and the Phillips curve.\n\nTHE DATA SETS CAN BE FOUND HERE.",

            "description": "How the Chinese Communist Party maintains its power by both repressing and responding to its people\n\nSince 1949, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has maintained unrivalled control over the country, persisting even in the face of economic calamity, widespread social upheaval, and violence against its own people. Yet the party does not sustain dominance through repressive tactics alone--it pairs this with surprising responsiveness to the public. The Party and the People explores how this paradox has helped the CCP endure for decades, and how this balance has shifted increasingly toward repression under the rule of President Xi Jinping.\n\nDelving into the tenuous binary of repression and responsivity, Bruce Dickson illuminates numerous questions surrounding the CCP's rule: How does it choose leaders and create policies? When does it allow protests? Will China become democratic? Dickson shows that the party's dual approach lies at the core of its practices--repression when dealing with existential, political threats or challenges to its authority, and responsiveness when confronting localized economic or social unrest. The state answers favorably to the demands of protesters on certain issues, such as local environmental hazards and healthcare, but deals harshly with others, such as protests in Tibet, Xinjiang, or Hong Kong. With the CCP's greater reliance on suppression since Xi Jinping's rise to power in 2012, Dickson considers the ways that this tipping of the scales will influence China's future.\n\nBringing together a vast body of sources, The Party and the People sheds new light on how the relationship between the Chinese state and its citizens shapes governance.\n\n\nAbout the Author: Bruce J. Dickson is professor of political science and international affairs and chair of the Department of Political Science at George Washington University.

            "description": "A landmark comparative history of Europe and China that examines why the Industrial Revolution emerged in the West\n\nThe Great Divergence sheds light on one of the great questions of history: Why did sustained industrial growth begin in Northwest Europe? Historian Kenneth Pomeranz shows that as recently as 1750, life expectancy, consumption, and product and factor markets were comparable in Europe and East Asia. Moreover, key regions in China and Japan were no worse off ecologically than those in Western Europe, with each region facing corresponding shortages of land-intensive products. Pomeranz's comparative lens reveals the two critical factors resulting in Europe's nineteenth-century divergence--the fortunate location of coal and access to trade with the New World. As East Asia's economy stagnated, Europe narrowly escaped the same fate largely due to favorable resource stocks from underground and overseas. This Princeton Classics edition includes a preface from the author and makes a powerful historical work available to new readers.\n\n\nAbout the Author: Kenneth Pomeranz is University Professor of History at the University of Chicago.

This book provides a blueprint for how to build and maintain that trust and connection in a digital environment.\" --Eric S. Yuan, founder and CEO of Zoom\n\nA Harvard Business School professor and leading expert in virtual and global work provides remote workers and leaders with the best practices necessary to perform at the highest levels in their organizations.\n\nThe rapid and unprecedented changes brought on by Covid-19 have accelerated the transition to remote working, requiring the wholesale migration of nearly entire companies to virtual work in just weeks, leaving managers and employees scrambling to adjust. This massive transition has forced companies to rapidly advance their digital footprint, using cloud, storage, cybersecurity, and device tools to accommodate their new remote workforce.\n\nExperiencing the benefits of remote working--including nonexistent commute times, lower operational costs, and a larger pool of global job applicants--many companies, including Twitter and Google, plan to permanently incorporate remote days or give employees the option to work from home full-time. But virtual work has it challenges. Employees feel lost, isolated, out of sync, and out of sight. They want to know how to build trust, maintain connections without in-person interactions, and a proper work/life balance. Managers want to know how to lead virtually, how to keep their teams motivated, what digital tools they'll need, and how to keep employees productive.\n\nProviding compelling, evidence-based answers to these and other pressing issues, Remote Work Revolution is essential for navigating the enduring challenges teams and managers face. Filled with specific actionable steps and interactive tools, this timely book will help team members deliver results previously out of reach. Following Neeley's advice, employees will be able to break through routine norms to successfully use remote work to benefit themselves, their groups, and ultimately their organizations.",

I'm so glad her thoughtful guidance is now available for women everywhere.\"--Hillary Rodham Clinton\n\nStephanie Schriock leads the leaders.\"--Michelle Lujan Grisham, governor of New Mexico\n\n\"Run to Win is an antidote to anxiety and a welcome call to action. I encourage every woman (and a few good men) to dive into Run to Win and take your turn at saving the world.\"--Stacey Abrams\n\nFrom the president of EMILY's List, a playbook for women changing the world in politics, business, or any arena, with a foreword from Vice President Elect Kamala Harris.\n\nFor the past thirty-five years EMILY's List has helped the campaigns of thousands of pro-choice Democratic women, but the hardest part has always been convincing more women to run. Then Donald Trump was elected, and something shifted into place. American women who were furious and frustrated were looking for a way to channel their outrage into action, united in proclaiming, If that guy can get elected, why not me?\n\nThe day after the 2016 election, dozens of women searched out an old sign-up link buried on the EMILY's List website. By Thanksgiving, those dozens had grown to a few thousand. And that was only the beginning. By the end of 2018, there were nearly fifty thousand women signed up to run for office, with scores more signing up each day.\n\nRun to Win is for all women who are looking to lead. Organized around the steps that EMILY's List coaches its candidates through (from deciding to run through celebrating victory), this book is full of essential lessons for any woman trying to succeed in a male-dominated field. Their arena is politics but their message is universal.\n\nAnd Stephanie Schriock is the most qualified person to share these lessons. Not only is she a powerful figure in politics but she's also a woman who commands respect for her astounding success as president of EMILY's List and a longtime Democratic operative. Her message is uplifting and actionable, her voice is that of your best girlfriend walking you through what you need to consider as you make your plan, and her experience coaching the biggest female candidates in recent elections (including all of the female 2020 Democratic presidential candidates) makes her the de facto authority on the strategies women can employ to run, fight, and win, whatever their field or goal.\nAbout the Author: Raised in the copper-mining town of Butte, Montana, Stephanie Schriock has been working to get Democrats elected for twenty-five years. Since Schriock became president of EMILY's List in 2010, she has overseen a decade of phenomenal growth in the organization, raising hundreds of millions of dollars, helping elect record numbers of women to the House and Senate, and recruiting and training hundreds more. EMILY's List is now nearly five million members strong.\n\nChristina Reynolds grew up in and around Marine bases across the country but considers herself a Tar Heel. For two decades she has worked for Democratic officials, from five presidential campaigns to Democratic campaign committees to the Obama White House. She currently serves as the vice president of communications for EMILY's List.",

            "description": "A Wall Street Journal Bestseller\n\nNamed a Financial Times top title\n\nHow to unleash human magic and achieve improbable results.\n\nHubert Joly, former CEO of Best Buy and orchestrator of the retailer's spectacular turnaround, unveils his personal playbook for achieving extraordinary outcomes by putting people and purpose at the heart of business.\n\nBack in 2012, Everyone thought we were going to die, says Joly. Eight years later, Best Buy was transformed as Joly and his team rebuilt the company into one of the nation's favorite employers, vastly increased customer satisfaction, and dramatically grew Best Buy's stock price. Joly and his team also succeeded in making Best Buy a leader in sustainability and innovation.\n\nIn The Heart of Business, Joly shares the philosophy behind the resurgence of Best Buy: pursue a noble purpose, put people at the center of the business, create an environment where every employee can blossom, and treat profit as an outcome, not the goal.\n\nThis approach is easy to understand, but putting it into practice is not so easy. It requires radically rethinking how we view work, how we define companies, how we motivate, and how we lead. In this book Joly shares memorable stories, lessons, and practical advice, all drawn from his own personal transformation from a hard-charging McKinsey consultant to a leader who believes in human magic.\n\nThe Heart of Business is a timely guide for leaders ready to abandon old paradigms and lead with purpose and humanity. It shows how we can reinvent capitalism so that it contributes to a sustainable future.\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nHubert Joly is the former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Best Buy Co., Inc. where he led the company's turnaround and transformed it into an industry leader, consistently rated one of the best places to work for. He is now a senior lecturer at the Harvard Business School.\n\nHe is also a member of the board of directors of Johnson & Johnson and Ralph Lauren Corporation, and a vice chairman of the Business Council. He has endowed the Joly Family chair in Purposeful Leadership at HEC Paris where he actively collaborates with the faculty.\n\nPrior to Best Buy, he was the CEO of Carlson Companies, a global leader in the hospitality and travel industry, a senior executive at Vivendi S.A., the president of EDS France and a partner at McKinsey & Company. He is a graduate of HEC Paris and Institut d'Etudes Politiques de Paris.\n\nHubert has been recognized as one of the top 100 CEOs in the world by Harvard Business Review, one of the top 30 CEOs in the world by Barron's, and one of the top 10 CEOs in the US by Glassdoor. He is a knight in the French Legion of Honor and the French National Order or Merit.\n\nWriter Caroline Lambert has collaborated on books with a wide range of change makers and thought leaders, including the former President of Malawi, anti-corruption crusaders, and entrepreneurs and government officials. Most recently, she cowrote the bestseller Aligned with Hortense le Gentil.\n\nAs a journalist and Deputy Asia Editor for The Economist, Caroline wrote about business, economics, and politics, earning the Diageo Africa Business Reporting Award and the Sanlam Award for Excellence in Financial Journalism. Caroline holds an MBA from INSEAD and an MA in international relations from the Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies, where she was awarded the Groove Haines Award in International Policy.

            "description": "Get to better, more effective strategy.\n\nIn nearly every business segment and corner of the world economy, the most successful companies dramatically outperform their rivals. What is their secret? In Better, Simpler Strategy, Harvard Business School professor Felix Oberholzer-Gee shows how these companies achieve more by doing less. At a time when rapid technological change and global competition conspire to upend traditional ways of doing business, these companies pursue radically simplified strategies. At a time when many managers struggle not to drown in vast seas of projects and initiatives, these businesses follow simple rules that help them select the few ideas that truly make a difference.\n\nBetter, Simpler Strategy provides readers with a simple tool, the value stick, which every organization can use to make its strategy more effective and easier to execute. Based on proven financial mechanics, the value stick helps executives decide where to focus their attention and how to deepen the competitive advantage of their business.\n\nHow does the value stick work? It provides a way of measuring the two fundamental forces that lead to value creation and increased financial success—the customer's willingness-to-pay and the employee's willingness-to-sell their services to the business. Companies that win, Oberholzer-Gee shows, create value for customers by raising their willingness-to-pay, and they provide value for talent by lowering their willingness-to-sell. The approach, proven in practice, is entirely data driven and uniquely suited to be cascaded throughout the organization.\n\nWith many useful visuals and examples across industries and geographies, Better, Simpler Strategy explains how these two key measures enable firms to gauge and improve their strategies and operations. Based on the author's sought-after strategy course, this book is your must-have guide for making better strategic decisions.\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nFelix Oberholzer-Gee is the Andreas Andresen Professor of Business Administration at Harvard Business School. An award-winning instructor, his academic work has been published in the very best peer-reviewed journals of his profession. He currently teaches competitive strategy in executive education programs such as the Harvard General Management Program. He also serves as faculty chair of the Senior Executive Leadership Program for China and the Driving Digital Strategy program. He is a cohost of the popular HBR Presents podcast After Hours.\n\nYou can find Felix Oberholzer-Gee at:\nhbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=251462\nlinkedin.com/in/felix-oberholzer-gee-16424b4/",

Power bled from her bones.\n\nThe battle on Sharr is over. The Arz has fallen. Altair may be captive, but Zafira, Nasir, and Kifah are bound for Sultan's Keep, determined to finish the plan Altair set in motion: restoring the hearts of the Sisters of Old to the minarets of each caliphate, finally bringing magic to all of Arawiya. But they are low on resources and allies alike, and the kingdom teems with fear of the Lion of the Night's return.\n\nAs the zumra plots to overthrow Arawiya's darkest threat, Nasir fights to command the magic in his blood. He must learn to hone his power, to wield it against not only the Lion but his father as well, trapped under the Lion's control. Zafira battles a very different darkness festering in her through her bond with the Jawarat--it hums with voices, pushing her to the brink of sanity and to the edge of a chaos she dares not unleash.

Contact tracing is key, the first step in a process that has proven effective: trace, test, and isolate. Smartphones can collect some of the information required by contact tracers--not just where you've been but also who's been near you. Can we repurpose the tracking technology that we carry with us--devices with GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and social media connectivity--to serve public health in a pandemic? In People Count, cybersecurity expert Susan Landau looks at some of the apps developed for contact tracing during the COVID-19 pandemic, finding that issues of effectiveness and equity intersect.\n\nLandau explains the effectiveness (or ineffectiveness) of a range of technological interventions, including dongles in Singapore that collect proximity information; India's biometric national identity system; Harvard University's experiment, TraceFi; and China's surveillance network. Other nations rejected China-style surveillance in favor of systems based on Bluetooth, GPS, and cell towers, but Landau explains the limitations of these technologies. She also reports that many current apps appear to be premised on a model of middle-class income and a job that can be done remotely. How can they be effective when low-income communities and front-line workers are the ones who are hit hardest by the virus?

Data--our data--is mined and processed for profit, power, and political gain. In Living in Data, Thorp asks a crucial question of our time: How do we stop passively inhabiting data, and instead become active citizens of it?\n\nThreading a data story through hippo attacks, glaciers, and school gymnasiums, around colossal rice piles, and over active minefields, Living in Data reminds us that the future of data is still wide open, that there are ways to transcend facts and figures and to find more visceral ways to engage with data, that there are always new stories to be told about how data can be used.\n\nPunctuated with Thorp's original and informative illustrations, Living in Data not only redefines what data is, but reimagines who gets to speak its language and how to use its power to create a more just and democratic future. Timely and inspiring, Living in Data gives us a much-needed path forward.\n\n\nAbout the Author: Jer Thorp is an artist, a writer, and a teacher.

            "description": "From Oxford's leading AI researcher comes a fun and accessible tour through the history and future of one of the most cutting edge and misunderstood field in science: Artificial Intelligence\n\nThe somewhat ill-defined long-term aim of AI is to build machines that are conscious, self-aware, and sentient; machines capable of the kind of intelligent autonomous action that currently only people are capable of. As an AI researcher with 25 years of experience, professor Mike Wooldridge has learned to be obsessively cautious about such claims, while still promoting an intense optimism about the future of the field. There have been genuine scientific breakthroughs that have made AI systems possible in the past decade that the founders of the field would have hailed as miraculous. Driverless cars and automated translation tools are just two examples of AI technologies that have become a practical, everyday reality in the past few years, and which will have a huge impact on our world.\n\nWhile the dream of conscious machines remains, Professor Wooldridge believes, a distant prospect, the floodgates for AI have opened. Wooldridge's A Brief History of Artificial Intelligence is an exciting romp through the history of this groundbreaking field--a one-stop-shop for AI's past, present, and world-changing future.\n\n\nAbout the Author: Michael Wooldridge is a professor of Computer Science and Head of the Department of Computer Science at the University of Oxford. Since earning his Ph.D. in AI, he has published more than 350 scientific articles on the subject. Mike has been at the heart of the AI community for a quarter of a century and knows most of the key figures in the international AI community.

            "authorName": "Thomas Rid",
            "description": "This revelatory and dramatic history of disinformation traces the rise of secret organized deception operations from the interwar period to contemporary internet troll farms\n\nWe live in the age of disinformation--of organized deception. Spy agencies pour vast resources into hacking, leaking, and forging data, often with the goal of weakening the very foundation of liberal democracy: trust in facts. Thomas Rid, a renowned expert on technology and national security, was one of the first to sound the alarm. More than four months before the 2016 election, he warned that Russian military intelligence was \"carefully planning and timing a high-stakes political campaign to disrupt the democratic process. But as crafty as such so-called active measures have become, they are not new.\n\nThe story of modern disinformation begins with the post-Russian Revolution clash between communism and capitalism, which would come to define the Cold War. In Active Measures, Rid reveals startling intelligence and security secrets from materials written in more than ten languages across several nations, and from interviews with current and former operatives. He exposes the disturbing yet colorful history of professional, organized lying, revealing for the first time some of the century's most significant operations--many of them nearly beyond belief. A White Russian ploy backfires and brings down a New York police commissioner; a KGB-engineered, anti-Semitic hate campaign creeps back across the Iron Curtain; the CIA backs a fake publishing empire, run by a former Wehrmacht U-boat commander, that produces Germany's best jazz magazine. Rid tracks the rise of leaking, and shows how spies began to exploit emerging internet culture many years before WikiLeaks. Finally, he sheds new light on the 2016 election, especially the role of the infamous \"troll farm\" in St. Petersburg as well as a much more harmful attack that unfolded in the shadows.\n\nActive Measures takes the reader on a guided tour deep into a vast hall of mirrors old and new, pointing to a future of engineered polarization, more active and less measured--but also offering the tools to cut through the deception.\n\n\nAbout the Author: Thomas Rid is a professor at Johns Hopkins University.

Nor will it create superintelligence anytime soon. But it will make huge advances in the next two decades, revolutionize medicine, entertainment, and transport, transform jobs and markets, and vastly increase the amount of information that governments and companies have about individuals.\n\nAI for Good leads off with economist and best-selling author Daron Acemoglu, who argues that there are reasons to be concerned about these developments. AI research today pays too much attention to the technological hurtles ahead without enough attention to its disruptive effects on the fabric of society: displacing workers while failing to create new opportunities for them and threatening to undermine democratic governance itself.\n\nBut the direction of AI development is not preordained. Acemoglu argues for its potential to create shared prosperity and bolster democratic freedoms. But directing it to that task will take great effort: It will require new funding and regulation, new norms and priorities for developers themselves, and regulations over new technologies and their applications.\n\nAt the intersection of technology and economic justice, this book will bring together experts--economists, legal scholars, policy makers, and developers--to debate these challenges and consider what steps tech companies can do take to ensure the advancement of AI does not further diminish economic prospects of the most vulnerable groups of population.\nAbout the Author: Daron Acemoglu is Charles P.

The company founded by two Stanford graduate students--Larry Page and Sergey Brin--has become a tech giant known the world over. Since starting with its search engine, Google has moved into mobile phones, computer operating systems, power utilities, self-driving cars, all while remaining the most powerful company in the advertising business.\n\nGranted unprecedented access to the company, Levy disclosed that the key to Google's success in all these businesses lay in its engineering mindset and adoption of certain internet values such as speed, openness, experimentation, and risk-taking. Levy discloses details behind Google's relationship with China, including how Brin disagreed with his colleagues on the China strategy--and why its social networking initiative failed; the first time Google tried chasing a successful competitor. He examines Google's rocky relationship with government regulators, particularly in the EU, and how it has responded when employees left the company for smaller, nimbler start-ups.\n\nIn the Plex is the \"most authoritative...and in many ways the most entertaining\" (James Gleick, The New York Book Review) account of Google to date and offers \"an instructive primer on how the minds behind the world's most influential internet company function\" (Richard Waters, The Wall Street Journal).",

But the truth is, our daily eating schedule--three meals a day, plus snacks--does not necessarily reflect our bodies' natural cycles. In fact, eating three meals every day can cause metabolic inflexibility, which can lead to inflammation, fatigue, and chronic health problems. For millions of years, our bodies have actually functioned best with periodic times of fasting.\n\nWith his fresh new approach to fasting, bestselling author and functional medicine expert Dr. Will Cole gives you the ability to take control of your hunger and make intermittent fasting intuitive. You'll get in touch with your instinctive eating patterns and become healthier and more mindful about how and when you eat. Intuitive Fasting will show you how to find metabolic flexibility--and once you've reached it, you can trust your body to function at optimal capacity, whether you've eaten six minutes ago or six hours ago.\n\nDuring his 4-Week Flexible Fasting Plan, Dr. Cole will guide you through varying intermittent fasting windows, with each week of the plan tailored to focus on a different aspect of your health. He illustrates the most effective ways to fast and eat to amplify the health benefits of intermittent fasting, balancing rest and repair with clean, nutrient-dense, delicious foods. By the end of the four weeks, you will have all the tools necessary to:\n\n- Reset your body\n- Recharge your metabolism\n- Renew your cells\n- Rebalance your hormones\n\nAlong with more than 65 recipes, you'll also find a maintenance plan, so you can adapt fasting and feeding windows to work sustainably with your lifestyle.\nAbout the Author: Dr. Will Cole, IFMCP, DNM, DC, is a leading functional medicine expert who consults with people around the world via webcam and locally in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

By the time they launched their second restaurant, Bavel, the love affair had expanded to cooks and food lovers nationwide. Bavel, the cookbook, invites home cooks to explore the broad and varied cuisines of the Middle East through fragrant spice blends; sublime zhougs, tahini, labneh, and hummus; rainbows of crisp-pickled vegetables; tender, oven-baked flatbreads; fall-off-the-bone meats and tagines; buttery pastries and tarts; and so much more.\n\nBavel--pronounced bah-VELLE, the Hebrew name for Babel--is a metaphor for the myriad cultural, spiritual, and political differences that divide us. The food of Bavel tells the many stories of the countries defined as \"the Middle East.\" These recipes are influenced by the flavors and techniques from all corners of the region, and many, such as Tomato with Smoked Harissa, Turmeric Chicken with Toum, and Date-Walnut Tart, are inspired by Menashe's Israeli upbringing and Gergis's Egyptian roots. Bavel celebrates the freedom to cook what we love without loyalty to any specific country, and represents a world before the region was divided into separate nations.

            "description": "From chef and food activist Alice Waters, an impassioned plea for a radical reconsideration of the way each and every one of us cooks and eats\n\nIn We Are What We Eat, Alice Waters urges us to take up the mantle of slow food culture, the philosophy at the core of her life's work. When Waters first opened Chez Panisse in 1971, she did so with the intention of feeding people good food during a time of political turmoil. Customers responded to the locally sourced organic ingredients, to the dishes made by hand, and to the welcoming hospitality that infused the small space--human qualities that were disappearing from a country increasingly seduced by takeout, frozen dinners, and prepackaged ingredients. Waters came to see that the phenomenon of fast food culture, which prioritized cheapness, availability, and speed, was not only ruining our health, but also dehumanizing the ways we live and relate to one another.\n\nOver years of working with regional farmers, Waters and her partners learned how geography and seasonal fluctuations affect the ingredients on the menu, as well as about the dangers of pesticides, the plight of fieldworkers, and the social, economic, and environmental threats posed by industrial farming and food distribution. So many of the serious problems we face in the world today--from illness, to social unrest, to economic disparity, and environmental degradation--are all, at their core, connected to food. Fortunately, there is an antidote. Waters argues that by eating in a \"slow food way,\" each of us--like the community around her restaurant--can be empowered to prioritize and nurture a different kind of culture, one that champions values such as biodiversity, seasonality, stewardship, and pleasure in work.\n\nThis is a declaration of action against fast food values, and a working theory about what we can do to change the course. As Waters makes clear, every decision we make about what we put in our mouths affects not only our bodies but also the world at large--our families, our communities, and our environment. We have the power to choose what we eat, and we have the potential for individual and global transformation--simply by shifting our relationship to food. All it takes is a taste.\n\nAbout the Author: Alice Waters is a chef and the founder/owner of Chez Panisse in Berkeley, California. She has won numerous awards, including the National Humanities Medal, the French Legion of Honor Medal, the Cavaliere of the Italian Republic, and three James Beards Awards. As vice president of Slow Food International and founder of the Edible Schoolyard Project, she has helped bring food awareness to people of all ages all over the world.",

In a rapidly modernizing Japan, the region--a stronghold of the country's old-fashioned ways--was quickly becoming a destination for chefs and artisans looking to learn about the traditions that have long shaped Japanese culture. Kirshner put on a vest and tie and took her place behind the saké bar. Before long, she met a community of craftspeople, farmers, and foragers--master woodturners, hunters, a paper artist, and a man making charcoal in his nearly abandoned village on the outskirts of town. Kirshner found each craftsperson not only exhibited an extraordinary dedication to their work but their distinct expertise contributed to the fabric of the local culture. Inspired by these masters, she devoted herself to learning how they work and live.\n\nTaking readers deep into evergreen forests, terraced rice fields, and smoke-filled workshops, Kirshner captures the centuries-old traditions still alive in Yamanaka. Water, Wood, and Wild Things invites readers to see what goes into making a fine bowl, a cup of tea, or a harvest of rice and introduces the masters who dedicate their lives to this work. Part travelogue, part meditation on the meaning of work, and full of her own beautiful drawings and recipes, Kirshner's refreshing book is an ode to a place and its people, as well as a profound examination of what it means to sustain traditions and find purpose in cultivation and craft.\nAbout the Author: Hannah Kirshner is a writer, artist, and food stylist whose work has appeared in The New York Times, Vogue, Saveur, Taste, Food52, Marie Claire, and Atlas Obscura, among others. Trained at the Rhode Island School of Design, Kirshner grew up on a small farm outside Seattle and divides her time between Brooklyn and rural Japan.",

After basic training, he volunteered for Pilot Training and qualified as an operational helicopter pilot going on to serve in Germany, Northern Ireland, Canada, Belize and Cyprus. At the age of 36, he left the Army Air Corps and transferred to the SAS. In 1980, Riley was a member of the United Kingdom Counter Terrorist team, which laid siege to the Iranian Embassy taken over by heavily armed terrorists later that year. In 1982, Riley escaped internment in Chile during the Falklands War as part of an audacious top-secret attempt to attack the Argentinian mainland. In 1989, when Riley left the army, he was quickly recruited by MI6 where he served until 2015. His autobiography, Kisses from Nimbus, was published in 2017. Riley and his wife Carol now split their time between homes in Manchester, England and the Mediterranean island of Mallorca, Spain.\n\nIan Sharp is an English film and television director. Widely admired for his television and film work, he is perhaps best known as the second unit director of the James Bond classic, Goldeneye, starring Pierce Brosnan. His work on that film's action sequences are considered among the best in the series.",

Rebecca then turned her passion for horticulture into a writing career. She became a columnist for multiple gardening magazines, writing in an informal, witty style in an effort to translate the often-esoteric body of horticultural information into user-friendly language for the novice. Rebecca wanted to utilize her user-friendly writing style to make grammar and punctuation rules clear (and as painless as possible) for her then middle-school-aged son.

This book is not just about life, but about discovery itself. It is about error and hubris, but also about wonder and the reach of science.\"\n--Siddhartha Mukherjee, New York Times Book Review\n\nWe all assume we know what life is, but the more scientists learn about the living world--from protocells to brains, from zygotes to pandemic viruses--the harder they find it is to locate life's edge.\n\nCarl Zimmer investigates one of the biggest questions of all: What is life? The answer seems obvious until you try to seriously answer it. Is the apple sitting on your kitchen counter alive, or is only the apple tree it came from deserving of the word? If we can't answer that question here on earth, how will we know when and if we discover alien life on other worlds? The question hangs over some of society's most charged conflicts--whether a fertilized egg is a living person, for example, and when we ought to declare a person legally dead.\n\nLife's Edge is an utterly fascinating investigation that no one but one of the most celebrated science writers of our generation could craft. Zimmer journeys through the strange experiments that have attempted to re-create life. Literally hundreds of definitions of what that should look like now exist, but none has yet emerged as an obvious winner. Lists of what living things have in common do not add up to a theory of life. It's never clear why some items on the list are essential and others not. Coronaviruses have altered the course of history, and yet many scientists maintain they are not alive. Chemists are creating droplets that can swarm, sense their environment, and multiply. Have they made life in the lab?\n\nWhether he is handling pythons in Alabama or searching for hibernating bats in the Adirondacks, Zimmer revels in astounding examples of life at its most bizarre. He tries his own hand at evolving life in a test tube with unnerving results. Charting the obsession with Dr. Frankenstein's monster and how the world briefly believed radium was the source of all life, Zimmer leads us all the way into the labs and minds of researchers engineering life from scratch.\nAbout the Author: Carl Zimmer writes the Matter column for The New York Times and has frequently contributed to The Atlantic, National Geographic, Time, and Scientific American. He has won the American Association for the Advancement of Science's Science Journalism Award three times, among a host of other awards and fellowships. He teaches science writing at Yale, has been a guest on NPR's RadioLab, Science Friday, and Fresh Air, and maintains an international speaking schedule. He is the author of thirteen books about science, including She Has Her Mother's Laugh.",

            "description": "This wide-ranging volume explores the tension between the dietary practice of veganism and the manifestation, construction, and representation of a vegan identity in today's society.\n\nEmerging in the early 21st century, vegan studies is distinct from more familiar conceptions of animal studies, an umbrella term for a three-pronged field that gained prominence in the late 1990s and early 2000s, consisting of critical animal studies, human animal studies, and posthumanism. While veganism is a consideration of these modes of inquiry, it is a decidedly different entity, an ethical delineator that for many scholars marks a complicated boundary between theoretical pursuit and lived experience. The Routledge Handbook of Vegan Studies is the must-have reference for the important topics, problems, and key debates in the subject area and is the first of its kind. Comprising over 30 chapters by a team of international contributors, this handbook is divided into five parts:\n\nHistory of vegan studies\nVegan studies in the disciplines\nTheoretical intersections\nContemporary media entanglements\nVeganism around the world\n\nThese sections contextualize veganism beyond its status as a dietary choice, situating veganism within broader social, ethical, legal, theoretical, and artistic discourses. This book will be essential reading for students and researchers of vegan studies, animal studies, and environmental ethics.\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nLaura Wright is a professor in the Department of English at Western Carolina University, USA.",

In this, he is every bit as good as the best scientist writers. --New York Times Book Review (Editors' Choice)\n\nBrilliant. ... A work of staggering depth. --Minneapolis Star Tribune\n\nA decade in the making, Fossil Men is a scientific detective story played out in anatomy and the natural history of the human body: the first full-length account of the discovery of a startlingly unpredicted human ancestor more than a million years older than Lucy\n\nIt is the ultimate mystery: where do we come from? In 1994, a team led by fossil-hunting legend Tim White uncovered a set of ancient bones in Ethiopia's Afar region. Radiometric dating of nearby rocks indicated the resulting skeleton, classified as Ardipithecus ramidus--nicknamed \"Ardi\"--was an astounding 4.4 million years old, more than a million years older than the world-famous \"Lucy.\" The team spent the next 15 years studying the bones in strict secrecy, all while continuing to rack up landmark fossil discoveries in the field and becoming increasingly ensnared in bitter disputes with scientific peers and Ethiopian bureaucrats. When finally revealed to the public, Ardi stunned scientists around the world and challenged a half-century of orthodoxy about human evolution--how we started walking upright, how we evolved our nimble hands, and, most significantly, whether we were descended from an ancestor that resembled today's chimpanzee. But the discovery of Ardi wasn't just a leap forward in understanding the roots of humanity--it was an attack on scientific convention and the leading authorities of human origins, triggering an epic feud about the oldest family skeleton.\n\nIn Fossil Men, acclaimed journalist Kermit Pattison brings us a cast of eccentric, obsessive scientists, including White, an uncompromising perfectionist whose virtuoso skills in the field were matched only by his propensity for making enemies; Gen Suwa, a Japanese savant whose deep expertise about teeth rivaled anyone on Earth; Owen Lovejoy, a onetime creationist-turned-paleoanthropologist with radical insights into human locomotion; Berhane Asfaw, who survived imprisonment and torture to become Ethiopia's most senior paleoanthropologist; Don Johanson, the discoverer of Lucy, who had a rancorous falling out with the Ardi team; and the Leakeys, for decades the most famous family in paleoanthropology.\n\nBased on a half-decade of research in Africa, Europe and North America, Fossil Men is not only a brilliant investigation into the origins of the human lineage, but the oldest of human emotions: curiosity, jealousy, perseverance and wonder.",

            "authorName": "Daniel R Headrick",
            "description": "Since the appearance of Homo sapiens on the planet hundreds of thousands of years ago, human beings have sought to exploit their environments, extracting as many resources as their technological ingenuity has allowed. As technologies have advanced in recent centuries, that impulse has remained\nlargely unchecked, exponentially accelerating the human impact on the environment.\n\nHumans versus Nature tells a history of the global environment from the Stone Age to the present, emphasizing the adversarial relationship between the human and natural worlds. Nature is cast as an active protagonist, rather than a mere backdrop or victim of human malfeasance. Daniel R. Headrick\nshows how environmental changes--epidemics, climate shocks, and volcanic eruptions--have molded human societies and cultures, sometimes overwhelming them. At the same time, he traces the history of anthropogenic changes in the environment--species extinctions, global warming, deforestation, and\nresource depletion--back to the age of hunters and gatherers and the first farmers and herders. He shows how human interventions such as irrigation systems, over-fishing, and the Industrial Revolution have in turn harmed the very societies that initiated them.\n\nThroughout, Headrick examines how human-driven environmental changes are interwoven with larger global systems, dramatically reshaping the complex relationship between people and the natural world. In doing so, he roots the current environmental crisis in the deep past.\n\nAbout the Author:\nDaniel R. Headrick is Professor of Social Science and History, emeritus, at Roosevelt University. He is the author of numerous books, including The Tools of Empire: Technology and European Imperialism in the Nineteenth Century (OUP); The Tentacles of Progress: Technology Transfer in the Age of\nImperialism (OUP); The Invisible Weapon: Telecommunications and International Politics, 1851-1945 (OUP); When Information Came of Age: Technologies of Knowledge in the Age of Reason and Revolution, 1700-1850 (OUP); Technology: A World History (OUP); and Power over Peoples: Technology, Environments,\nand Western Imperialism, 1400 to the Present.

Even on the hottest summer days this book will transport you.\"\n--Helen Macdonald, author of H is for Hawk, in Kirkus\n\nI saw my first Blakiston's fish owl in the Russian province of Primorye, a coastal talon of land hooking south into the belly of Northeast Asia . . . No scientist had seen a Blakiston's fish owl so far south in a hundred years . . .\n\nWhen he was just a fledgling birdwatcher, Jonathan C. Slaght had a chance encounter with one of the most mysterious birds on Earth. Bigger than any owl he knew, it looked like a small bear with decorative feathers. He snapped a quick photo and shared it with experts. Soon he was on a five-year journey, searching for this enormous, enigmatic creature in the lush, remote forests of eastern Russia. That first sighting set his calling as a scientist.\n\nDespite a wingspan of six feet and a height of over two feet, the Blakiston's fish owl is highly elusive. They are easiest to find in winter, when their tracks mark the snowy banks of the rivers where they feed. They are also endangered. And so, as Slaght and his devoted team set out to locate the owls, they aim to craft a conservation plan that helps ensure the species' survival. This quest sends them on all-night monitoring missions in freezing tents, mad dashes across thawing rivers, and free-climbs up rotting trees to check nests for precious eggs. They use cutting-edge tracking technology and improvise ingenious traps. And all along, they must keep watch against a run-in with a bear or an Amur tiger. At the heart of Slaght's story are the fish owls themselves: cunning hunters, devoted parents, singers of eerie duets, and survivors in a harsh and shrinking habitat.\n\nThrough this rare glimpse into the everyday life of a field scientist and conservationist, Owls of the Eastern Ice testifies to the determination and creativity essential to scientific advancement and serves as a powerful reminder of the beauty, strength, and vulnerability of the natural world.\n\n\nAbout the Author: Jonathan C. Slaght is the Russia and Northeast Asia coordinator for the Wildlife Conservation Society, where he manages research projects on endangered species and coordinates avian conservation activities along the East Asia-Australasian Flyway from the Arctic to the tropics.

This book brings together essays that individually and as a whole present a detailed and rigorous multidisciplinary exploration of the concept of nature and its wider ethical and political implications.\n\nA distinguished list of scholars take up a broad range of questions regarding the relations between the human subject and its natural environment: when and how the concept of nature gave way to the concept of natural resources; the genealogy of the concept of nature through political economy, theology, and modern science; the idea of the Anthropocene; the prospects for green growth; and the deep alienation of human beings in the modern period from both nature and each other. By engaging with a wide range of scholarship, they ultimately converge on a common outlook that is both capacious and original. The essays together present a revaluation of the natural world that seeks to reshape political and ethical ideals and practice with a view to addressing some of the fundamental concerns of our time.\n\nNature and Value features widely known scholars in a broad swath of disciplines, ranging from philosophy, politics, and political economy to geology, law, literature, and psychology.

Jona is about to move away; he calls his wife, who's already settled in Berlin, before trying to make plans with friends for one last night on the town. No one bites--they're all busy or maybe they just don't want to party--but he's determined to make this night something to remember. Victoria is lively and energetic, but surrounded by friends and family who are buzzkills, always worrying about what is best for her. Rodolphe glumly considers his own misery and then suddenly snaps out of it, becoming the life of the party. The three careen through the city's nightlife spots and underbelly, getting ever deeper in the messiness of human existence as they chase pleasure--or at least a few distractions from their daily lives. Each has a series of misadventures that reveal them to be teetering on the edge of despair, of destruction, of becoming the people they'll be for the rest of their lives. The City of Belgium occupies a place between lucid dream and tooth-grinding nightmare.\n\n\nAbout the Author: The Belgian cartoonist Brecht Evens was born in 1986 and studied illustration in Ghent, Belgium.

A powerful comment on duty, betrayal, infidelity and honour, it is also about women's struggle to retain autonomy in a world that privileges men, as Chitra transforms an ancient story into a gripping, contemporary battle of wills.

That is, he loves spending time with them when they come out to Palm Springs for weeklong visits, or when he heads home to Connecticut for the holidays.

Despite having a set of Guncle Rules ready to go, Patrick has no idea what to expect, having spent years barely holding on after the loss of his great love, a somewhat-stalled acting career, and a lifestyle not-so-suited to a six- and a nine-year-old.

The rugged, steep terrain and thick forests made the region a natural hiding spot for targets in the American war on terror, from Osama bin Laden to the Islamic State, and it has been the site of constant U.S. military activity for nearly two decades. Even as the U.S. presence in Afghanistan transitions to a drone war, the Pech has remained at the center of it, a testbed for a new method of remote warfare.\n\nWesley Morgan first visited the Pech in 2010, while he was still a college student embedding with military units as a freelancer. By then, the Pech and its infamous tributary the Korengal had become emblematic of the war, but Morgan found that few of the troops fighting there could explain why their remote outposts had been built. In The Hardest Place, he unravels the history those troops didn't know, captures the culture and reality of the war through both American and Afghan eyes, and reports on the snowballing American missteps that made each unit's job harder than the last as storied outfits like Marines, paratroopers, Rangers, Green Berets, and SEALs all took their turn.\n\nThrough reporting trips, hundreds of interviews with Americans and Afghans, and documentary research, Morgan writes vividly of large-scale missions gone awry, years-long hunts for single individuals, and the soldiers, Marines, commandos, and intelligence operatives who cycle through, along with several who return again and again to the same slowly evolving fight.\n\nAs the war drags on through its fourth presidential administration, Morgan concludes that we've created a status quo that could last forever in the Pech, with the military and intelligence agencies always in search of the next target.\nAbout the Author: Wesley Morgan is a military affairs reporter who most recently covered the Pentagon for two and a half years at Politico. He previously worked as a freelance journalist in Washington, D.C., Iraq, and Afghanistan, contributing stories to The Washington Post, The New York Times, The Atlantic and other publications.

An anthology of texts and fragments woven together with an original commentary, the volume widens our understanding of the full complexity and richness of this period of radical thought and practice. The book covers the generational turbulence of Italy's postwar period, the transformations of Italian capitalism, the new analyses by worker-focused intellectuals, the student movement of 1968, the Hot Autumn of 1969, the extra-parliamentary groups of the early 1970s, the Red Brigades, the formation of a radical women's movement, the development of Autonomia, and the build-up to the watershed moment of the spontaneous political movement of 1977. Far from being merely a handbook of political history, The Golden Horde also sheds light on two decades of Italian culture, including the newspapers, songs, journals, festivals, comics, and philosophy that these movements produced.

            "authorName": "Stephen Biddle",
            "description": "How nonstate military strategies overturn traditional perspectives on warfare\n\nSince September 11th, 2001, armed nonstate actors have received increased attention and discussion from scholars, policymakers, and the military. Underlying debates about nonstate warfare and how it should be countered is one crucial assumption: that state and nonstate actors fight very differently. In Nonstate Warfare, Stephen Biddle upturns this distinction, arguing that there is actually nothing intrinsic separating state or nonstate military behavior. Through an in-depth look at nonstate military conduct, Biddle shows that many nonstate armies now fight more conventionally than many state armies, and that the internal politics of nonstate actors--their institutional maturity and wartime stakes rather than their material weapons or equipment--determines tactics and strategies.\n\nBiddle frames nonstate and state methods along a continuum, spanning Fabian-style irregular warfare to Napoleonic-style warfare involving massed armies, and he presents a systematic theory to explain any given nonstate actor's position on this spectrum. Showing that most warfare for at least a century has kept to the blended middle of the spectrum, Biddle argues that material and tribal culture explanations for nonstate warfare methods do not adequately explain observed patterns of warmaking. Investigating a range of historical examples from Lebanon and Iraq to Somalia, Croatia, and the Vietcong, Biddle demonstrates that viewing state and nonstate warfighting as mutually exclusive can lead to errors in policy and scholarship.\n\nA comprehensive account of combat methods and military rationale, Nonstate Warfare offers a new understanding for wartime military behavior.\n\n\nAbout the Author: Stephen Biddle is professor of international and public affairs at Columbia University and adjunct senior fellow for defense policy at the Council on Foreign Relations. He is the author of Military Power: Explaining Victory and Defeat in Modern Battle (Princeton).",

            "description": "A detailed guide to the breath-focused meditation practice of Kriya yoga for spiritual growth, inner stillness, and self-realization\n\n- Explains the basic techniques of the practice, detailing proper posture, breathwork exercises (pranayama), bandhas, third-eye gazing, and the use of mantra\n\n- Presents advanced, yet simple, techniques that accelerate a contemplative practice by micro-modulations related to posture, respiration, visualization, and sound\n\n- Includes wisdom from the author's teacher Ganesh Baba on the importance of the spine in Kriya yoga and the Cycle of Synthesis, a model of the human experience\n\nKriya yoga is an ancient meditation technique that focuses on breathing and the spine to unlock deep states of awareness, self-realization, and spiritual growth. Kriya can provide a fast path to awakening, yet its practice has been shrouded in secrecy, passed only from master to initiate for millennia.\n\nIntroduced into Kriya 40 years ago, Keith Lowenstein, M.D., offers an accessible yet detailed guide to Kriya yoga. He explains the basic techniques of the practice step by step, detailing proper posture, breathwork exercises (pranayama), visualization practices, and mantra. He reveals how Kriya is a scientific art--if practiced consistently, it will allow you to quickly enter deep states of meditation and ultimately experience inner stillness. He also explores how the practice of Kriya leads to healing and the development of compassion and the freeing joy of the union of Nature and Spirit.\n\nSharing the wisdom of his Kriya yoga teacher Ganesh Baba, the author adds a detailed understanding of anatomy, especially the importance of the spine in Kriya yoga and energy flow. The author explores Ganesh Baba's teachings on spirit-infused science and the integration of Vedic philosophy, quantum mechanics, prana, and spiritualization illustrated in the Cycle of Synthesis. He also discusses the relationship between the exercises of Kriya yoga and Patanjali's Yoga Sutras as well as teachings from his other teachers, including Paramahansa Hariharananda.\n\nWith this guide, you will gain an understanding not only of the practice of Kriya yoga but also of the spiritual wealth it brings, including the ultimate self-realization of non-dual reality.\nAbout the Author: Keith G. Lowenstein, M.D., is board certified in psychiatry and integrative medicine. He began his study of the mind-body interface in 1971 with training in transcendental meditation and in 1980 began his training in Kriya yoga with Ganesh Baba. He maintains an integrative mental health private practice in Portland, Oregon. Andrea J. Lett, M.A., is a body-mind wellness practitioner with 20 years' experience practicing and teaching meditation and yoga. An award-winning writer, she lives in Portland, Oregon.",

Constantly reframed and mythicised by Westerners fleeing their supposedly rationalist societies, India continues to fascinate with its millennia-old history, its shrines on every street corner, its ancient beliefs and rituals, and its unique linguistic and cultural diversity.\n\nToday this picture is mixed with that of a society that is changing at a frenetic pace and is at the forefront of the digital revolution--a \"shining India\" of dynamic, fast-expanding megalopolises. Yet, these success stories coexist with the daily plight of the large section of India's population without access to drinking water or a toilet, with a rural economy (still employing the majority of India's over 1.3 billion inhabitants) that depends on monsoons for irrigation and is threatened by climate change. The greatest democratic experiment ever attempted, India remains plagued by one of the vilest forms of class and racial discrimination, the caste system, which is being exacerbated by the Hindu nationalist regime currently in power.\n\nAll things considered, though, it is hard to find a more dynamic and optimistic country or, as Arundhati Roy puts it, \"a more irredeemably chaotic people.\" This volume aims to depict India's chaos and its contradictions, its terror and its joy, from the struggle of the Kashmiri people to that of non-believers (hated by all religious sects), from the dances of the hijra in Koovagam to the success of the wrestler Vinesh Phogat, a symbol of the women who seek to free themselves from the oppressive patriarchal mores. Despite the obstacles and steps back, India continues its journey on the long path towards freedom and towards ending poverty for some of the world's most destitute people.",

            "authorName": "Robert J C Young",
            "description": "Postcolonialism explores the political, social, and cultural effects of decolonization, continuing the anti-colonial deconstruction of western dominance. This Very Short Introduction discusses both the history and key debates of postcolonialism, and considers its importance as a means of changing the way we think about the world.\n\nRobert J. C. Young examines the key strategies that postcolonial thought has developed to engage with the impact of sometimes centuries of western political and cultural domination. Situating the discussion in a wide cultural and geographical context, he draws on examples such as the status of indigenous peoples, of those dispossessed from their land, Algerian rai music, and global social and ecological movements. In this new edition he also includes updated material on race, slavery, and postcolonial gender politics. Above all, Young argues that postcolonialism offers a political philosophy of activism that contests the current situation of global inequality, which in a new way continues the anti-colonial struggles of the past and enables us to decolonize our own lives in the present.\n\nABOUT THE SERIES: The Very Short Introductions series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area These pocket-sized books are the perfect way to get ahead in a new subject quickly Our expert authors combine facts, analysis, perspective, new ideas, and enthusiasm to make interesting and challenging topics highly readable\n\nAbout the Author:\nRobert J. C. Young is Julius Silver Professor of English and Comparative Literature at New York University.

            "description": "NATIONAL BEST SELLER - Antitrust enforcement is one of the most pressing issues facing America today--and Amy Klobuchar, the widely respected senior senator from Minnesota, is leading the charge. This fascinating history of the antitrust movement shows us what led to the present moment and offers achievable solutions to prevent monopolies, promote business competition, and encourage innovation.\n\nIn a world where Google reportedly controls 90 percent of the search engine market and Big Pharma's drug price hikes impact healthcare accessibility, monopolies can hurt consumers and cause marketplace stagnation. Klobuchar--the much-admired former candidate for president of the United States--argues for swift, sweeping reform in economic, legislative, social welfare, and human rights policies, and describes plans, ideas, and legislative proposals designed to strengthen antitrust laws and antitrust enforcement.\n\nKlobuchar writes of the historic and current fights against monopolies in America, from Standard Oil and the Sherman Anti-Trust Act to the Progressive Era's trust-busters; from the breakup of Ma Bell (formerly the world's biggest company and largest private telephone system) to the pricing monopoly of Big Pharma and the future of the giant tech companies like Facebook, Amazon, and Google.\n\nShe begins with the Gilded Age (1870s-1900), when builders of fortunes and rapacious robber barons such as J. P. Morgan, John Rockefeller, and Cornelius Vanderbilt were reaping vast fortunes as industrialization swept across the American landscape, with the rich getting vastly richer and the poor, poorer. She discusses President Theodore Roosevelt, who, during the Progressive Era (1890s-1920), busted the trusts, breaking up monopolies; the Clayton Act of 1914; the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914; and the Celler-Kefauver Act of 1950, which it strengthened the Clayton Act. She explores today's Big Pharma and its price-gouging; and tech, television, content, and agriculture communities and how a marketplace with few players, or one in which one company dominates distribution, can hurt consumer prices and stifle innovation.\n\nAs the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy, and Consumer Rights, Klobuchar provides a fascinating exploration of antitrust in America and offers a way forward to protect all Americans from the dangers of curtailed competition, and from vast information gathering, through monopolies.\nAbout the Author: AMY KLOBUCHAR is the senior senator from Minnesota, the first woman from that state to be elected to the U.S. Senate.

In Power to the Public, Tara Dawson McGuinness and Hana Schank describe a revolutionary new approach--public interest technology--that has the potential to transform the way governments and nonprofits around the world solve problems. Through inspiring stories about successful projects ranging from a texting service for teenagers in crisis to a streamlined foster care system, the authors show how public interest technology can make the delivery of services to the public more effective and efficient.\n\nAt its heart, public interest technology means putting users at the center of the policymaking process, using data and metrics in a smart way, and running small experiments and pilot programs before scaling up. And while this approach may well involve the innovative use of digital technology, technology alone is no panacea--and some of the best solutions may even be decidedly low-tech.\n\nClear-eyed yet profoundly optimistic, Power to the Public presents a powerful blueprint for how government and nonprofits can help solve society's most serious problems.\n\n\nAbout the Author: Tara Dawson McGuinness is the founder of the New Practice Lab at New America and teaches public problem solving at Georgetown University's McCourt School of Public Policy.

            "description": "For 40 years, this classic text has taken the issue of economic inequality seriously and asked: Why are our prisons filled with the poor? Why aren't the tools of the criminal justice system being used to protect Americans from predatory business practices and to punish well-off people who cause widespread harm?\n\nThis new edition continues to engage readers in important exercises of critical thinking: Why has the U.S. relied so heavily on tough crime policies despite evidence of their limited effectiveness, and how much of the decline in crime rates can be attributed to them? Why does the U.S. have such a high crime rate compared to other developed nations, and what could we do about it? Are the morally blameworthy harms of the rich and poor equally translated into criminal laws that protect the public from harms on the streets and harms from the suites? How much class bias is present in the criminal justice system - both when the rich and poor engage in the same act, and when the rich use their leadership of corporations to perpetrate mass victimization?\n\nThe Rich Get Richer shows readers that much of what goes on in the criminal justice system violates citizens' sense of basic fairness. It presents extensive evidence from mainstream data that the criminal justice system does not function in the way it says it does nor in the way that readers believe it should. The authors develop a theoretical perspective from which readers might understand these failures and evaluate them morally--and they to do it in a short text written in plain language.\n\nReaders who are not convinced about the larger theoretical perspective will still have engaged in extensive critical thinking to identify their own taken-for-granted assumptions about crime and criminal justice, as well as uncover the effects of power on social practices. This engagement helps readers develop their own worldview.\n\nNew to this edition:\n\nPresents recent data comparing the harms due to criminal activity with the harms of dangerous--but not criminal--corporate actions\nUpdates statistics on crime, victimization, incarceration, wealth, and discrimination\nIncreased material for thinking critically about criminal justice and criminology\nIncreased discussion of the criminality of middle- and upper-class youth\nIncreased coverage of role of criminal justice fines and fees in generating revenue for government, and how algorithms reproduce class bias while seeming objective\nStreamlined and condensed prose for greater clarity\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nJeffrey Reiman is the William Fraser McDowell Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at American University in Washington, DC.

Barnett was only a law student when she came across the case that would change her life forever--that of Sharanda Jones, single mother, business owner, and, like Brittany, Black daughter of the rural South. A victim of America's devastating war on drugs, Sharanda had been torn away from her young daughter and was serving a life sentence without parole--for a first-time drug offense. In Sharanda, Brittany saw haunting echoes of her own life, as the daughter of a formerly incarcerated mother. As she studied this case, a system came into focus in which widespread racial injustice forms the core of America's addiction to incarceration. Moved by Sharanda's plight, Brittany set to work to gain her freedom.\n\nThis had never been the plan. Bright and ambitious, Brittany was a successful accountant on her way to a high-powered future in corporate law. But Sharanda's case opened the door to a harrowing journey through the criminal justice system.

            "authorName": "Timo Steffens",
            "description": "An increasing number of countries develop capabilities for cyber-espionage and sabotage. The sheer number of reported network compromises suggests that some of these countries view cyber-means as integral and well-established elements of their strategical toolbox. At the same time the relevance of such attacks for society and politics is also increasing. Digital means were used to influence the US presidential election in 2016, repeatedly led to power outages in Ukraine, and caused economic losses of hundreds of millions of dollars with a malfunctioning ransomware. In all these cases the question who was behind the attacks is not only relevant from a legal perspective, but also has a political and social dimension.\n\nAttribution is the process of tracking and identifying the actors behind these cyber-attacks. Often it is considered an art, not a science.\n\nThis book systematically analyses how hackers operate, which mistakes they make, and which traces they leave behind. Using examples from real cases the author explains the analytic methods used to ascertain the origin of Advanced Persistent Threats.\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nDr. Timo Steffens was involved in the analysis of many of the most spectacular cyber-espionage cases in Germany. He has been tracking the activities and techniques of sophisticated hacker groups for almost a decade.\n\n\n",

            "description": "Gabriel García Márquez's novel One Hundred Years of Solitude seemed destined for obscurity upon its publication in 1967. The little-known author, small publisher, magical style, and setting in a remote Caribbean village were hardly the usual ingredients for success in the literary marketplace. Yet today it ranks among the best-selling books of all time. Translated into dozens of languages, it continues to enter the lives of new readers around the world. How did One Hundred Years of Solitude achieve this unlikely success? And what does its trajectory tell us about how a work of art becomes a classic?\n\nAscent to Glory is a groundbreaking study of One Hundred Years of Solitude, from the moment García Márquez first had the idea for the novel to its global consecration. Using new documents from the author's archives, Álvaro Santana-Acuña shows how García Márquez wrote the novel, going beyond the many legends that surround it. He unveils the literary ideas and networks that made possible the book's creation and initial success. Santana-Acuña then follows this novel's path in more than seventy countries on five continents and explains how thousands of people and organizations have helped it to become a global classic. Shedding new light on the novel's imagination, production, and reception, Ascent to Glory is an eye-opening book for cultural sociologists and literary historians as well as for fans of García Márquez and One Hundred Years of Solitude.\nAbout the Author: Álvaro Santana-Acuña is an assistant professor of sociology at Whitman College.",

            "description": "Dynamics of Caste and Law breaks new ground in understanding how caste and law relate in India's democratic order. Caste has become a visible phenomenon often associated with discrimination, inequality and politics in India and globally. India's constitutional democracy has had a remarkable goal of creating equality in a context of caste. Despite constitutional promises with equal opportunities for the lower castes and outlawing of untouchability at the time of independence, recurring atrocities and inadequate implementation of law have called for rethinking and legal change. This book sheds new light on why caste oppression persists by using new theoretical perspectives as well as Bhimrao Ambedkar's concepts of the caste system. Focusing on struggles among India's Dalits, the castes formerly known as untouchables, the book draws on a rich material and explains, among other things, mechanisms of oppression and how powerful actors may gain influence in institutions of law and state.",

Woodard, in uniform, was arrested by the local police chief, Lynwood Shull, and beaten and blinded while in custody.\n\nPresident Harry Truman was outraged by the incident. He established the first presidential commission on civil rights and his Justice Department filed criminal charges against Shull. In July 1948, following his commission's recommendation, Truman ordered an end to segregation in the U.S. armed forces. An all-white South Carolina jury acquitted Shull, but the presiding judge, J. Waties Waring, was conscience-stricken by the failure of the court system to do justice by the soldier. Waring described the trial as his \"baptism of fire,\" and began issuing major civil rights decisions from his Charleston courtroom, including his 1951 dissent in Briggs v. Elliott declaring public school segregation per se unconstitutional. Three years later, the Supreme Court adopted Waring's language and reasoning in Brown v. Board of Education.\n\n\nAbout the Author: Richard Gergel is a United States district judge who presides in the same courthouse in Charleston, South Carolina, where Judge Waring once served. A native of Columbia, South Carolina, Judge Gergel earned undergraduate and law degrees from Duke University.

They then explore specific examples, including how use of force against ISIS in Syria has changed the law of self-defense against non-state actors, how the allied airstrikes in response to Syria's use of chemical weapons have changed the law of humanitarian intervention, and others.

Rosen, a veteran legal journalist, scholar, and president of the National Constitution Center, shares with us the justice's observations on a variety of topics, and her intellect, compassion, sense of humor, and humanity shine through. The affection they have for each other as friends is apparent in their banter and in their shared love for the Constitution--and for opera.\n\nIn Conversations with RBG, Justice Ginsburg discusses the future of Roe v. Wade, her favorite dissents, the cases she would most like to see overruled, the #MeToo movement, how to be a good listener, how to lead a productive and compassionate life, and of course the future of the Supreme Court itself. These frank exchanges illuminate the steely determination, self-mastery, and wit that have inspired Americans of all ages to embrace the woman known to all as \"Notorious RBG.\"\n\nWhatever the topic, Justice Ginsburg always has something interesting--and often surprising--to say. And while few of us will ever have the opportunity to chat with her face-to-face, Jeffrey Rosen brings us by her side as never before. Conversations with RBG is a deeply felt portrait of an American hero.\n\n\nAbout the Author: Jeffrey Rosen is the author of nonfiction books, including the recent Louis D.

This book investigates the identification and regulation of religion through an intellectual history of law's creation of religion from the colonial to the post-colonial. Moving beyond conventional explanations on the failure of secularism and the secular state, it argues that the impasse in the legal regulation of religion lies in the methodologies and frameworks used by British colonial administrators in identifying and governing religion. Drawing on insights from post-colonial theory and religious studies, it demonstrates the role of secular legal reasoning in the background of Western intellectual history and Christian theology through an illustration of the place of worship. It is a contribution to South Asian legal history and sociolegal studies analysing court archives, colonial narratives and legislative documents.",

Thank you, Jonathan Balcombe, for reminding us of the infinite marvels of everyday creatures.\n--Sy Montgomery, Author of How to Be a Good Creature\n\nFrom an expert in animal consciousness, a book that will turn the fly on the wall into the elephant in the room.\n\nFor most of us, the only thing we know about flies is that they're annoying, and our usual reaction is to try to kill them. In Super Fly, the myth-busting biologist Jonathan Balcombe shows the order Diptera in all of its diversity, illustrating the essential role that flies play in every ecosystem in the world as pollinators, waste-disposers, predators, and food source; and how flies continue to reshape our understanding of evolution. Along the way, he reintroduces us to familiar foes like the fruit fly and mosquito, and gives us the chance to meet their lesser-known cousins like the Petroleum Fly (the only animal in the world that breeds in crude oil) and the Chocolate Midge (the sole pollinator of the Cacao tree). No matter your outlook on our tiny buzzing neighbors, Super Fly will change the way you look at flies forever.\n\nJonathan Balcombe is the author of four books on animal sentience, including the New York Times bestselling What A Fish Knows, which was nominated for the PEN/E.O. Wilson Award for Science Writing. He has worked for years as a researcher and educator with the Humane society to show us the consciousness of other creatures, and here he takes us to the farthest reaches of the animal kingdom.\nAbout the Author: Jonathan Balcombe was born in England, and has lived in New Zealand, the United States, and Canada. A biologist with a PhD in ethology, the study of animal behavior, he is the author of four popular science books on the inner lives of animals, as well as over 60 scientific papers and book chapters on animal behavior and animal protection. Formerly Department Chair for Animal Studies with the Humane Society University, and Director of Animal Sentience with The Humane Society Institute for Science and Policy, he also serves as an Associate Editor for the journal Animal Sentience, and he teaches a course in animal sentience for the Viridis Graduate Institute. Jonathan currently lives in southern Ontario, where in his spare time he enjoys biking, baking, birding, Bach, and trying to understand the squirrels in his neighborhood.",

In this book, Furio Jesi takes up the term in order to trace the contours of that political, artistic, and aesthetic thread as it runs through German literary and artistic culture in the period--which, in the 1930s, became absorbed by Nazism as part of its prophecy of a triumphant future. Drawing on thinkers like Carl Jung and writers such as Thomas Mann and Rainer Maria Rilke, Jesi reveals a literary genre that was transformed, tragically, into a potent political myth.\n\nAbout the Author: Furio Jesi (1941-80) was an Italian writer, translator, mythologist, and Germanist. A correspondent of Thomas Mann and Károly Kerényi, he worked on a number of studies of Egyptian and classical mythology.

LeGuin, Toni Cade Bambara, Jhumpa Lahiri, Sandra Cisneros, and Ted Chiang, hand-selected by celebrated editor and anthologist John Freeman\n\nIn the past fifty years, the American short story has changed dramatically. New voices, forms, and mixtures of styles have brought this unique genre a thrilling burst of energy. The Penguin Book of the Modern American Short Story celebrates this avalanche of talent.\n\nThis rich anthology begins in 1970 and brings together a half century of powerful American short stories from all genres, including--for the first time in a collection of this scale--science fiction, horror, and fantasy, placing writers such as Ursula K. Le Guin, Ken Liu, and Stephen King next to some beloved greats of the literary form: Raymond Carver, Grace Paley, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, and Denis Johnson. Culling widely, John Freeman, the former editor of Granta and now editor of his own literary annual, brings forward some astonishing work to be regarded in a new light. Often overlooked tales by Dorothy Allison, Percival Everett, and Charles Johnson will recast the shape and texture of today's enlarging atmosphere of literary dialogue. Stories by Lauren Groff and Ted Chiang raise the specter of engagement in ecocidal times. Short tales by Tobias Wolff, George Saunders, and Lydia Davis rub shoulders with near novellas by Susan Sontag and Andrew Holleran.

He is also the author of two poetry collections, Maps and The Park. His work is translated into more than twenty languages, and has appeared in The New Yorker, The Paris Review, and The New York Times.

These writings on the human condition by one of the twentieth century's great philosophers explore the absurdity of our notions of good and evil, and show instead how we make our own destiny simply by being.\n\nThroughout history, some books have changed the world. They have transformed the way we see ourselves - and each other. They have inspired debate, dissent, war and revolution. They have enlightened, outraged, provoked and comforted. They have enriched lives--and upended them. Now Penguin brings you a new set of the acclaimed Great Ideas, a curated library of selections from the works of the great thinkers, pioneers, radicals and visionaries whose ideas shook civilization and helped make us who we are.\nAbout the Author: Simone de Beauvoir (1908-1986) was a French philosopher, novelist, and essayist, and the lifelong companion of Jean-Paul Sartre. De Beauvoir's first book, L'Invitée, was published in 1943. In 1945 she published Le Sang des autres, a novel dealing with the question of political involvement. Beauvoir's breakthrough work was the semiautobiographical Les Mandarins (1954), which won the Prix Concourt. Roman Catholic authorities banned it and de Beauvoir's feminist classic The Second Sex (1949), in which de Beauvoir argued that one is not born a woman; one becomes one.",

The poems are both timeless and timely, asking how we can ever truly know ourselves in the face of our own remembering and inevitable forgetting. Here, the poems metaphorically argue that memory is made up of various colors, with those most prominent moments in a life seeming more vivid, though the paler colors are never truly forgotten. The poems in Pale Colors in a Tall Field approach their points of view kaleidoscopically, enacting the self's multiplicity and the difficult shifts required as our lives, in turn, shift. This is one of Phillips's most tender, dynamic, and startling books yet.\n\n\nAbout the Author: Carl Phillips teaches at Washington University in St. Louis.

            "description": "Very Short Introductions: Brilliant, Sharp, Inspiring\n\nFrom the simplest bacteria to humans, all living things are composed of cells of one type or another, all of which have fundamentally the same chemistry. This chemistry must provide mechanisms that allow cells to interact with the external world, a means to power the cell, machinery to carry out varied processes within the cell, a structure within which everything runs, and also governance through a web of interlocking chemical reactions. Biochemistry is the study of those reactions, the molecules that are created, manipulated, and destroyed as a result of them, and the massive macromolecules (such as DNA, cytoskeletons, proteins and carbohydrates) that form the chemical machinery and structures on which these biochemical reactions take place.\n\nIt didn't take long for an understanding of the chemistry of life to turn into a desire to manipulate it. Drugs and therapies all aim to modify biochemical processes for good or ill: Penicillin, derived from mould, stops bacteria making their cell walls. Aspirin, with its origins in willow bark, inhibits enzymes involved in inflammatory responses. A few nanograms of botulinum toxin (botox), can kill by preventing the release of neurotransmitters from the ends of nerves and so leads to paralysis and death, or give a wrinkle free forehead (if administered in very tiny quantities).This Very Short Introduction discusses the key concepts of biochemistry, as well as the historical figures in the field and the molecules they studied, before considering the current science and innovations in the field, and the interaction between biochemistry, biotechnology, and synthetic biology.\n\nABOUT THE SERIES: The Very Short Introductions series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area. These pocket-sized books are the perfect way to get ahead in a new subject quickly. Our expert authors combine facts, analysis, perspective, new ideas, and enthusiasm to make interesting and challenging topics highly readable.\n\nAbout the Author:\nMark Lorch, University of Hull\n\nMark Lorch is Head of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of Hull, as well as being Professor of Science Communication and Public Engagement.

            "description": "This open access book focuses on practical clinical problems that are frequently encountered in stroke rehabilitation. Consequences of diseases, e.g. impairments and activity limitations, are addressed in rehabilitation with the overall goal to reduce disability and promote participation. Based on the available best external evidence, clinical pathways are described for stroke rehabilitation bridging the gap between clinical evidence and clinical decision-making. The clinical pathways answer the questions which rehabilitation treatment options are beneficial to overcome specific impairment constellations and activity limitations and are well acceptable to stroke survivors, as well as when and in which settings to provide rehabilitation over the course of recovery post stroke.\n\n\nEach chapter starts with a description of the clinical problem encountered. This is followed by a systematic, but concise review of the evidence (RCTs, systematic reviews and meta-analyses) that is relevant for clinical decision-making, and comments on assessment, therapy (training, technology, medication), and the use of technical aids as appropriate. Based on these summaries, clinical algorithms / pathways are provided and the main clinical-decision situations are portrayed.\n\nThe book is invaluable for all neurorehabilitation team members, clinicians, nurses, and therapists in neurology, physical medicine and rehabilitation, and related fields. It is a World Federation for NeuroRehabilitation (WFNR) educational initiative, bridging the gap between the rapidly expanding clinical research in stroke rehabilitation and clinical practice across societies and continents. It can be used for both clinical decision-making for individuals and as well as clinical background knowledge for stroke rehabilitation service development initiatives.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nThomas Platz was educated at the medical school in Heidelberg/Mannheim, Germany, and in 1988 at the Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA, received his Dr. med. degree in 1990.

            "description": "An argument that we have a moral duty to explore other planets and solar systems--because human life on Earth has an expiration date.\n\nInevitably, life on Earth will come to an end, whether by climate disaster, cataclysmic war, or the death of the sun in a few billion years. To avoid extinction, we will have to find a new home planet, perhaps even a new solar system, to inhabit. In this provocative and fascinating book, Christopher Mason argues that we have a moral duty to do just that. As the only species aware that life on Earth has an expiration date, we have a responsibility to act as the shepherd of life-forms--not only for our species but for all species on which we depend and for those still to come (by accidental or designed evolution). Mason argues that the same capacity for ingenuity that has enabled us to build rockets and land on other planets can be applied to redesigning biology so that we can sustainably inhabit those planets. And he lays out a 500-year plan for undertaking the massively ambitious project of reengineering human genetics for life on other worlds.\n\nAs they are today, our frail human bodies could never survive travel to another habitable planet. Mason describes the toll that long-term space travel took on astronaut Scott Kelly, who returned from a year on the International Space Station with changes to his blood, bones, and genes. Mason proposes a ten-phase, 500-year program that would engineer the genome so that humans can tolerate the extreme environments of outer space--with the ultimate goal of achieving human settlement of new solar systems. He lays out a roadmap of which solar systems to visit first, and merges biotechnology, philosophy, and genetics to offer an unparalleled vision of the universe to come.\nAbout the Author: Christopher E. Mason is a geneticist and computational biologist who has been a Principal Investigator and Co-investigator of seven NASA missions and projects. He is Professor at Weill Cornell Medicine, with affiliate appointments at the Meyer Cancer Center, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, the Information Society Project (ISP) at Yale Law School, and the Consortium for Space Genetics at Harvard Medical School.",

Dr. Borba combed scientific studies on resilience, spoke to dozens of researchers/experts in the field and interviewed more than 100 young people from all walks of life, and she found something surprising: the difference between those who struggle and those who succeed comes down not to grades or test scores, but to seven character traits that set Thrivers apart (and set them up for happiness and greater accomplishment later in life).\n\nThese traits--confidence, empathy, self-control, integrity, curiosity, perseverance, and optimism--will allow kids to roll with the punches and succeed in life. And the even better news: these traits can be taught to children at any age...in fact, parents and educations must do so. In Thrivers, Dr. Borba offers practical, actionable ways to develop these traits in children from preschool through high school, showing how to teach kids how to cope today so they can thrive tomorrow.\nAbout the Author: Michele Borba, EdD, is the author of UnSelfie: Why Empatheic Kids Succeed in Our All-About Me World, and is an internationally renowned educational psychologist and an expert in parenting, bullying, and character development. She is a regular NBC contributor who appears regularly on Today and has been featured as an expert on Dateline, The View, Dr. Phil, NBC Nightly News, Fox & Friends, Dr. Oz, and The Early Show, among many others.

            "authorName": "Craig Brown",
            "description": "Winner of the 2020 Baillie Gifford Prize for Non-Fiction\n\nA distinctive portrait of the Fab Four by one of the sharpest and wittiest writers of our time\n\nIf you want to know what it was like to live those extraordinary Beatles years in real time, read this book. --Alan Johnson, The Spectator\n\nThough fifty years have passed since the breakup of the Beatles, the fab four continue to occupy an utterly unique place in popular culture. Their influence extends far beyond music and into realms as diverse as fashion and fine art, sexual politics and religion. When they appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1964, fresh off the plane from England, they provoked an epidemic of hoarse-throated fandom that continues to this day.\n\nWho better, then, to capture the Beatles phenomenon than Craig Brown--the inimitable author of Ninety-Nine Glimpses of Princess Margaret and master chronicler of the foibles and foppishness of British high society? This wide-ranging portrait of the four lads from Liverpool rivals the unique spectacle of the band itself by delving into a vast catalog of heretofore unexamined lore.\n\nWhen actress Eleanor Bron touched down at Heathrow with the Beatles, she thought that a flock of starlings had alighted on the roof of the terminal--only to discover that the birds were in fact young women screaming at the top of their lungs. One journalist, mistaken for Paul McCartney as he trailed the band in his car, found himself nearly crushed to death as fans climbed atop the vehicle and pressed their bodies against the windshield. Or what about the Baptist preacher who claimed that the Beatles synchronized their songs with the rhythm of an infant's heartbeat so as to induce a hypnotic state in listeners? And just how many people have employed the services of a Canadian dentist who bought John Lennon's tooth at auction, extracted its DNA, and now offers paternity tests to those hoping to sue his estate?\n\n150 Glimpses of the Beatles is, above all, a distinctively kaleidoscopic examination of the Beatles' effect on the world around them and the world they helped bring into being. Part anthropology and part memoir, and enriched by the recollections of everyone from Tom Hanks to Bruce Springsteen, this book is a humorous, elegiac, and at times madcap take on the Beatles' role in the making of the sixties and of music as we know it.\n\n\nAbout the Author: Craig Brown is the author of more than fifteen books, among them the New York Times bestseller Ninety-Nine Glimpses of Princess Margaret, and was a finalist for a National Book Critics Circle Award. He has been a columnist for The Guardian, The Times (London), Spectator, and The Daily Telegraph, and currently writes for The Daily Mail.",

Lenny Kravitz looks back at his life with candor, self-scrutiny, and humor.\n\n\"My life is all about opposites,\" he writes. \"Black and white. Jewish and Christian. The Jackson 5 and Led Zeppelin. I accepted my Gemini soul. I owned it. I adored it. Yins and yangs mingled in various parts of my heart and mind, giving me balance and fueling my curiosity and comfort.\"\n\nLet Love Rule covers a vast canvas stretching from Manhattan's Upper East Side, Brooklyn's Bedford-Stuyvesant, Los Angeles's Baldwin Hills and Beverly Hills, and finally to France, England, and Germany.\n\nIt's the story of a wildly creative kid who, despite tough struggles at school and extreme tension at home, finds salvation in music.\n\nWe see him grow as a musician and ultimately become a master songwriter, producer, and performer. We also see Lenny's spiritual growth--and the powerful way in which spirit informs his music.\n\nThe cast of characters surrounding Lenny is extraordinary: his father, Sy, a high-powered news executive; his mother, Roxie Roker, a television star; and Lisa Bonet, the young actress who becomes his muse.\n\nThe central character, of course, is Lenny, who, despite his great aspirational energy, turns down record deal after record deal until he finds his true voice.\n\nThe creation of that voice, the same voice that is able to declare \"Let Love Rule\" to an international audience, is the very heart of this story.\n\n\"Whether recording, performing, or writing a book,\" says Lenny, \"my art is about listening to the inspiration inside and then sharing it with people. Art must bring the world closer together.\"\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nLenny Kravitz has sold some fifty million records over a career spanning three decades.\n\nDavid Ritz has collaborated with everyone from Ray Charles to Aretha Franklin.",

            "description": "\"I'm both blessed and cursed to be a guitar player. I didn't choose it, it chose me. The challenge was to find a way to weave my convictions into my music in a meaningful way.\" - Tom Morello\n\nAs the cofounder and guitarist of Rage Against the Machine, Audioslave, and Prophets of Rage, and as a solo artist and collaborator with artists as diverse as Bruce Springsteen and Wu-Tang Clan, few musicians have been as groundbreaking as Tom Morello. Now, for the first time, Morello's remarkable life as a guitarist, songwriter, singer, and political activist is captured in Whatever It Takes.\n\nTelling the story from his first guitar to the present day, Morello's commentary is accompanied by a wealth of photographs, handwritten notes, and set lists, many of which are previously unpublished and come from the author's personal archives. Stunning images of Morello's heavily customized guitars complete this jam-packed photographic memoir, and the result, like his incendiary guitar playing, is fascinating, honest, and completely unique.\n\nIntroduced by the Oscar-winning filmmaker Michael Moore, Jann Wenner, the cofounder of Rolling Stone, Morello's Prophets of Rage collaborator Chuck D, and Nora Guthrie, daughter of the legendary Woody Guthrie, Whatever It Takes is the defining document of one of the greatest rock guitar players of our times.\n\n\"He's not only the most dangerous guitarist in history, he just might be the best.\" - Michael Moore\n\n\"He's not only a brilliant musician, but he has a deep heart and a social conscience, just like Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Bono, or Jackson Browne. Tom is right up there with that gang. I think this excellent book helps prove why.\" - Jann Wenner\n\n\"Tom Morello is a Visionary Activist, meaning what he sees in his mind goes full throttle into him making IT happen.\" - Chuck D\n\n\"A musician who has no fear, who is not afraid of a good fight, and has no hesitation. When Tom Morello sings \"This Is Your Land\" he demands we jump up and sing with our fists raised.\" - Nora Guthrie\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nTom Morello is living proof of the transformative power of rock 'n' roll. As the co-founder of Rage Against the Machine, Audioslave and Prophets of Rage, and through collaborations with everyone from Bruce Springsteen to Johnny Cash, he has continually pushed the limits of what one man can do with six strings.\n\n\"I've been devoted both musically and as an activist to fighting injustice at every turn,\" says Morello. \"Amid this heightened sense of impending doom, it's now time to rally the troops in a last-ditch effort to save the planet, and our artistic souls. By challenging the boundaries of what music is and has sounded like before, you can open peoples' eyes to changing the status quo in society.\"",

            "description": "Don't let anxiety and depression keep you from living life to the fullest.\n\nIf you suffer from co-occurring anxiety and depression, you may experience an overwhelming urge to avoid difficult emotions and emotional experiences. The last thing you want to do is kick the hornet's nest you carry around with you. However, the latest research in psychology emphasizes the importance of approaching--rather than avoiding--your emotions. Avoiding emotions works in the short term, but in the long term it only teaches you to believe you can't handle your feelings. What you need is a solid set of tools that will allow you to feel a full range of emotions with confidence. This book will provide just the tool set you require.\n\nIn this workbook, psychologist Michael Tompkins offers evidence-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) skills to help you target and tear down the emotional avoidance barriers that drive your anxiety and depression. By engaging with the emotions you've been seeking to avoid, you'll learn, \"I can handle this feeling.\" You'll also find strategies to help you stay calm during emotional situations; and discover relaxation and mindfulness techniques to deal effectively with difficult thoughts and feelings, and improve your mood and well-being.\n\nThe tools in this workbook help you learn this important lesson: You can handle emotions, even unpleasant ones. When you believe you can handle feeling anxious and depressed, you're less likely to avoid those feelings, creating space for you to be more willing to do the things that you want to do in your life.\n\n\nAbout the Author: Michael A. Tompkins, PhD, ABPP, is a board-certified psychologist in behavioral and cognitive psychology. He is codirector of the San Francisco Bay Area Center for Cognitive Therapy; and assistant clinical professor of psychology at the University of California, Berkeley.

            "description": "*One of Bloomberg's Best Books of the Year*\n\nThe master geopolitical forecaster and New York Times bestselling author of The Next 100 Years focuses on the United States, predicting how the 2020s will bring dramatic upheaval and reshaping of American government, foreign policy, economics, and culture.\n\nIn his riveting new book, noted forecaster and bestselling author George Friedman turns to the future of the United States. Examining the clear cycles through which the United States has developed, upheaved, matured, and solidified, Friedman breaks down the coming years and decades in thrilling detail.\nAmerican history must be viewed in cycles--particularly, an eighty-year institutional cycle that has defined us (there are three such examples--the Revolutionary War/founding, the Civil War, and World War II), and a fifty-year socio-economic cycle that has seen the formation of the industrial classes, baby boomers, and the middle classes. These two major cycles are both converging on the late 2020s--a time in which many of these foundations will change. The United States will have to endure upheaval and possible conflict, but also, ultimately, increased strength, stability, and power in the world.\nFriedman's analysis is detailed and fascinating, and covers issues such as the size and scope of the federal government, the future of marriage and the social contract, shifts in corporate structures, and new cultural trends that will react to longer life expectancies. This new book is both provocative and entertaining.\nAbout the Author: GEORGE FRIEDMAN is founder and chairman of Geopolitical Futures, which specializes in geopolitical forecasting. Prior to this Friedman was chairman of the global intelligence company Stratfor, which he founded in 1996. Friedman is the author of six books, including the New York Times bestsellers The Next Decade and The Next 100 Years. He lives in Austin, Texas.",

            "authorName": "Luke Patey",
            "description": "A critical look at how the world is responding to China's rise, and what this means for America and the world.\n\nChina is advancing its own interests with increasing aggression. From its Belt and Road Initiative linking Asia and Europe, to its Made in China 2025 strategy to dominate high-tech industries, to its significant economic reach into Africa and Latin America, the regime is rapidly expanding its influence around the globe. Many fear that China's economic clout, tech innovations, and military power will allow it to remake the world in its own authoritarian image. But despite all these strengths, a future with China in charge is far from certain. Rich and poor, big and small, countries around the world are recognizing that engaging China produces new strategic vulnerabilities to their independence and competitiveness.\n\nHow China Loses tells the story of China's struggles to overcome new risks and endure the global backlash against its assertive reach. Combining on-the-ground reportage with incisive analysis, Luke Patey argues that China's predatory economic agenda, headstrong diplomacy, and military expansion undermine its global ambitions to dominate the global economy and world affairs. In travels to Africa, Latin America, East Asia and Europe, his encounters with activists, business managers, diplomats, and thinkers reveal the challenges threatening to ground China's rising power.\n\nAt a time when views are fixated on the strategic competition between China and the United States, Patey's work shows how the rest of the world will shape the twenty-first century in pushing back against China's overreach and domineering behavior. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries began to confront their political differences and economic and security challenges with China and realize the diversity and possibility for cooperation in the world today.\n\nAbout the Author:\nLuke Patey is a senior researcher at the Danish Institute for International Studies and Lead Senior Research Fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, University of Oxford. His articles have appeared in The New York Times, Financial Times, The Guardian, The Hindu, Foreign Affairs, and Foreign Policy.

It situates the lived experience of claiming adequate housing within informal transactions and negotiations of patronage networks vis-à-vis the formal institutional opportunities and closures of Indian democracy. In doing so, this research extends an innovative array of conceptual and methodological tools to grasp the context in which housing claims succeed and fail. This book contributes by responding to critical areas of social movement scholarship and by displaying community engagements and tactical strategies to bring about transformative change to claim adequate housing and resist co-opting forces for socially sustainable housing futures.",

This book, in contrast, places Kashmir and Kashmiris at the center of historical debate and investigates a broad range of sources to illuminate a century of political players and social structures on both sides of divided Kashmir and in the wider Kashmiri diaspora. In the process, it broadens the contours of Kashmir's postcolonial and resistance history, complicates the meaning of Kashmiri identity, and reveals Kashmiris' myriad imaginings of freedom. It asserts that 'Kashmir' has emerged as a political imaginary in postcolonial era, a vision that grounds Kashmiris in their negotiations for rights not only in India and Pakistan, but also in global political spaces.",

            "description": "Within Asia, the period from 1840s to 1960s had witnessed the rise and decline of Pax Britannica, the growth of multiple and often competing anti-colonial movements, and the entrenchment of the nation-state system. Beyond Pan-Asianism seeks to demonstrate the complex interactions between\nChina, India, and their neighbouring societies against this background of imperialism and nationalist resistance.\nThe contributors to this volume, from India, the West, and the Chinese-speaking world, cover a tremendous breadth of figures, including novelists, soldiers, intelligence officers, archivists, among others, by deploying published and archival materials in multiple Asian and Western languages. This\nvolume also attempts to answer the question of how China-India connectedness in the modern period should be narrated. Instead of providing one definite answer, it engages with prevailing and past frameworks-notably 'Pan-Asianism' and 'China/India as Method'-with an aim to provoke further discussions\non how histories of China-India and, by extension the non-Western world, can be conceptualized.\n\nAbout the Author:\nTansen Sen, Professor of History, NYU Shanghai, China, Brian Tsui, Associate Professor, Department of Chinese Culture, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University\n\nTansen Sen is Professor, History; Director, Center for Global Asia, NYU Shanghai, China; and Global Network Professor, NYU, New York, USA.\n\nBrian Tsui Kai Hin is Associate Professor, Department of Chinese Culture, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong.\n",

            "description": "Yang Jisheng's The World Turned Upside Down is the definitive history of the Cultural Revolution, in withering and heartbreaking detail.\n\nAs a major political event and a crucial turning point in the history of the People's Republic of China, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) marked the zenith as well as the nadir of Mao Zedong's ultra-leftist politics. Reacting in part to the Soviet Union's revisionism that he regarded as a threat to the future of socialism, Mao mobilized the masses in a battle against what he called bourgeois forces within the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). This ten-year-long class struggle on a massive scale devastated traditional Chinese culture as well as the nation's economy.\n\nFollowing his groundbreaking and award-winning history of the Great Famine, Tombstone, Yang Jisheng here presents the only history of the Cultural Revolution by an independent scholar based in mainland China, and makes a crucial contribution to understanding those years' lasting influence today.\n\nThe World Turned Upside Down puts every political incident, major and minor, of those ten years under extraordinary and withering scrutiny, and arrives in English at a moment when contemporary Chinese governance is leaning once more toward a highly centralized power structure and Mao-style cult of personality.\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nYang Jisheng was born in 1940, joined the Communist Party in 1964, and worked for the Xinhua News Agency from January 1968 until his retirement in 2001. For fifteen years, he was a deputy editor at Yanhuang Chunqiu (Chronicles of History), an official journal that regularly skirts censorship with articles on controversial political topics. In 2015, he resigned under official pressure. Yang currently serves on the editorial board of Economic Reference, while continuing to write political commentaries. For his groundbreaking work Tombstone (FSG, 2012), Yang won Sweden's Stieg Larsson prize for journalistic courage in 2015, and the Louis M. Lyons Award for Conscience and Integrity in Journalism, presented by the Nieman Fellows at Harvard University in 2016. Tombstone also won the Manhattan Institute's 2013 Hayek Prize and the 2013 Lemkin Award of the Institute for the Study of Genocide. Yang Jisheng lives in Beijing with his wife and two children.\n\nStacy Mosher learned Chinese in Hong Kong, where she lived for nearly 18 years. A long-time journalist, Mosher currently works as an editor and translator in Brooklyn.\n\nGuo Jian is Professor of English at the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater.

            "authorName": "Stephen Kendrick",
            "description": "[An] inspiring book about the events leading up to the 1960 election, from Dr. King's imprisonment to student activism in Atlanta to JFK's campaign. It's a story we can all learn from--a story of overlooked heroes and the power each of us has to create change. --Barack Obama\n\nA New York Times Book Review Editors' Choice One of O magazine's best books of February 2021\n\nThe authors of Douglass and Lincoln present fully for the first time the story of Martin Luther King, Jr.'s imprisonment in the days leading up to the 1960 presidential election and the efforts of three of John F. Kennedy's civil rights staffers who went rogue to free him--a move that changed the face of the Democratic Party and propelled Kennedy to the White House.\n\nLess than three weeks before the 1960 presidential election, thirty-one-year-old Martin Luther King, Jr. was arrested at a sit-in at Rich's Department Store in Atlanta. That day would lead to the first night King had ever spent in jail--and the time that King's family most feared for his life.\n\nAn earlier, minor traffic ticket served as a pretext for keeping King locked up, and later for a harrowing nighttime transfer to Reidsville, the notorious Georgia state prison where Black inmates worked on chain gangs overseen by violent white guards. While King's imprisonment was decried as a moral scandal in some quarters and celebrated in others, for the two presidential candidates--John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon--it was the ultimate October surprise: an emerging and controversial civil rights leader was languishing behind bars, and the two campaigns raced to decide whether, and how, to respond.\n\nStephen and Paul Kendrick's Nine Days tells the incredible story of what happened next. In 1960, the Civil Rights Movement was growing increasingly inventive and energized while white politicians favored the corrosive tactics of silence and stalling--but an audacious team in the Kennedy campaign's Civil Rights Section (CRS) decided to act. In an election when Black voters seemed poised to split their votes between the candidates, the CRS convinced Kennedy to agitate for King's release, sometimes even going behind his back in their quest to secure his freedom. Over the course of nine extraordinary October days, the leaders of the CRS--pioneering Black journalist Louis Martin, future Pennsylvania senator Harris Wofford, and Sargent Shriver, the founder of the Peace Corps--worked to tilt a tight election in Kennedy's favor and bring about a revolution in party affiliation whose consequences are still integral to the practice of politics today.\n\nBased on fresh interviews, newspaper accounts, and extensive archival research, Nine Days is the first full recounting of an event that changed the course of one of the closest elections in American history. Much more than a political thriller, it is also the story of the first time King refused bail and came to terms with the dangerous course of his mission to change a nation. At once a story of electoral machinations, moral courage, and, ultimately, the triumph of a future president's better angels, Nine Days is a gripping tale with important lessons for our own time.\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nStephen Kendrick is the author of Holy Clues: The Gospel According to Sherlock Holmes and Night Watch (a novel). His work has appeared in The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Boston Globe, The Hartford Current, American Heritage, Huffington Post, and Utne Reader.\n\nPaul Kendrick is a writer whose work has appeared in The New York Times, The Washington Post, USA Today, American Heritage, Talking Points Memo, and Huffington Post.\n\nTogether, they are the coauthors of Douglass and Lincoln: How a Revolutionary Black Leader and a Reluctant Liberator Struggled to End Slavery and Save the Union and Sarah's Long Walk: The Free Blacks of Boston and How Their Struggle for Equality Changed America.",

            "description": "Making strategy requires undertaking major--often irreversible--decisions aimed at long-term success in an uncertain future. All leaders must formulate a clear course of action, yet many lack confidence in their ability to think systematically about their strategy. They struggle to apply the abstract lessons offered by conventional approaches to strategic analysis to their unique contexts.\n\nMaking Great Strategy resolves these challenges with a straightforward, readily applicable framework. Jesper B. Sørensen and Glenn R. Carroll show that one factor underlies all sustainably successful strategies: a logically coherent argument that connects resources, capabilities, and environmental conditions to desired outcomes. They introduce a system for formulating and managing strategy through a set of three core activities: visualization, formalization and logic, and constructive argumentation. These activities can be implemented in any organization and are illustrated through examples and case studies from well-known companies such as Apple, Walmart, and The Economist.\n\nThis book shows that while great strategic thinking is hard, it is not a mystery. Widely applicable and relevant for managers and leaders at all levels, especially executive teams charged with setting the course of their organizations, it is essential reading for anyone faced with practical problems of strategic management.\nAbout the Author: Jesper B. Sørensen is the Robert A. and Elizabeth R. Jeffe Professor of Organizational Behavior at the Stanford Graduate School of Business.

With twenty-seven years of Amazon experience between them--much of it during the period of unmatched innovation that created products and services including Kindle, Amazon Prime, Amazon Studios, and Amazon Web Services--Bryar and Carr offer unprecedented access to the Amazon way as it was developed and proven to be repeatable, scalable, and adaptable.\n\nWith keen analysis and practical steps for applying it at your own company--no matter the size--the authors illuminate how Amazon's fourteen leadership principles inform decision-making at all levels of the company. With a focus on customer obsession, long-term thinking, eagerness to invent, and operational excellence, Amazon's ground-level practices ensure these characteristics are translated into action and flow through all aspects of the business.\n\nWorking Backwards is both a practical guidebook and the story of how the company grew to become so successful. It is filled with the authors' in-the-room recollections of what \"Being Amazonian\" is like and how their time at the company affected their personal and professional lives. They demonstrate that success on Amazon's scale is not achieved by the genius of any single leader, but rather through commitment to and execution of a set of well-defined, rigorously-executed principles and practices--shared here for the very first time.\n\nWhatever your talent, career or organization might be, find out how you can put Working Backwards to work for you.\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nCOLIN BRYAR joined Amazon in 1998 -- four years after its founding -- and spent the next 12 years as part of Amazon's senior leadership team as Amazon grew from a domestic (US-only) seller of books to a global, multi-dimensional powerhouse and innovator.

After Amazon, he and his family relocated to Singapore for two years where Colin served as Chief Operating Officer of e-commerce company RedMart, which was subsequently sold to Alibaba.

Whatever part of it we inhabit or function in, everything within it is connected in some way to other components, both within and outside the part we occupy.

This is particularly true of the massive, widely impactful problems we face. Unfortunately, systems thinking is not a part of most people's education, though it is probably the most crucial foundation for everything we do.\n\nSystems Thinking and Other Dangerous Habits aims to alleviate this widespread unawareness of the importance of viewing everything we think and do through the lens of systems. It begins with a review of some high-visibility systemic failures, segues into the history and basics of systems thinking, then examines some critical areas of systems knowledge, tools, and human motivation.\n\nThis book is an introduction to systems thinking, pointing the reader to important topics worthy of more comprehensive research.",

            "description": "We are living in a time when behavioral change is necessary for our health and survival. Yet we find it exceedingly difficult to transform our own habits, let alone those of other people. Enter Naohiro Matsumura, whose powerful new design method is as astonishingly simple in its logic as it is sophisticated in its psychology. It allows any of us--from UX designers and marketers to concerned citizens and overworked parents--to address challenges in our homes, our public spaces, and our social interactions.\n\nAs Matsumura shows, a shikake--or \"device\" in Japanese--is a design that exerts influence on us through subtle nudging, rather than direct command; it encourages a particular behavior without telling its (often unwitting) user the primary purpose of that behavior. For example:\n\n- Footprints in a store guide shoppers and keep them socially distant\n- A basketball hoop placed over a trash can entices children to tidy up their rooms\n- A symbol of a shrine in a public square encourages respectfulness\n- A staircase painted to look like piano keys prompts exercise through play\n\nCombining traditional Japanese aesthetics with the lessons of behavioral economics, Matsumura reveals how to identify the hidden design cues that already shape our world, and how shikakes can help us confront some of the most pressing challenges of our era, from pandemics to declining civic engagement to climate change and beyond. Mind-bending yet elegant, Shikake presents a tool kit for anyone who wants to create their own mindful designs, for the delight and betterment of us all.",

            "description": "The United States is supposed to offer economic opportunity to everyone. It shouldn't take a worldwide pandemic and nationwide protests to bring economic and racial inequality to the forefront of problems we desperately need to solve. But now that the opportunity is here, what should we do? How can we create more equality, opportunity, and growth for everyone? Not someday, but what can government and the private sector do right now to disrupt a status quo that almost everyone wants to change?\n\nIn Common Sense, the New York Times best-selling author Joel Greenblatt offers an investor's perspective on building an economy that truly works for everyone. With dry wit and engaging storytelling, he makes a lively and provocative case for disruptive new approaches--some drawn from personal experience, some from the outside looking in. How can leading corporations immediately disrupt our education establishment while creating high-paying job opportunities for those currently left behind? If we want a living wage for everyone, how can we afford it while using an existing program to get it done now? If we subsidize banks, what simple changes can we make to the way we capitalize and regulate them to help grow the economy, increase access, and create more jobs (while keeping the risks and benefits where they belong)? Greenblatt also explains how dramatically increasing immigration would be like giving every American a giant bonus and the reason Australia might be the best place to learn about saving for retirement.\n\nNot everyone will agree with what Greenblatt has to say--but all of us can benefit from the conversations he aims to start.\nAbout the Author: Joel Greenblatt is the managing principal and co-chief investment officer of Gotham Asset Management, the successor to Gotham Capital, an investment firm he founded in 1985. He has been a professor on the adjunct faculty of Columbia Business School for over two decades, and he is a cofounder and former chairman of the Success Academy Charter Network.

Sheeran reviews the place of ethics in philosophy, links it to political and administrative theory and practice, and analyzes the ethical theories and concepts from which ethical principles are derived.\n\nBefore delving into ethics as part of philosophy, Sheeran provides the reader with a brief overview of philosophy and its principal subjects, including ontology, epistemology, and psychology. He offers several definitions of ethics, and discusses both the objectivist (absolutist) and interpretivist (situation ethics) perspectives. Sheeran focuses on the subject matter of ethics, human actions, and their morality, exploring Natural Law, man-made law, and conscience as sources for determining the morality of human action. In later chapters, he applies his discussion of ethics to such controversial policy issues as suicide, murder, abortion, sterilization, capital punishment, war, lying, and strikes. Recommended for graduate and upper division undergraduate courses in public administration, public policy, management, and administrative behavior.\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nPATRICK J. SHEERAN holds a Doctorate in Public Administration, a Masters in International Relations from the University of Southern California. Sheeran is a former Catholic priest, and has taught various graduate courses in public administration, including ethics, at the University of Southern California, George Mason, and Shenandoah Universities.

            "description": "State Management offers a comprehensive yet concise introduction to the new field of state management, presenting an analysis of basic questions within the theories of bureaucracy, policy-making, principal-agent modelling and policy networks. Focussing upon recent state transformation, it illuminates public sector reform strategies such as New Public Management as well as incorporation, tendering and bidding, decentralization, team production and  privatization.\n\nThis book argues that we should look upon the variety of models or approaches to public management or public administration as all belonging under \"state management\". The so-called \"working state\" in a well-ordered society involves government delivering services, paying for social security and respecting the rule of law. In this text, Jan-Erik Lane systematically examines the key approaches to the study of how government attempts to achieve these goals, discussing the pros and cons of alternative frameworks of analysis.\n\n\nEach chapter discusses a different issue within state management that is integral to the broader debate, including:\n\nPublic regulation\n\nThe relationship between the law and the state\n\nCombining ecology and policy making\n\nMulti-level governance\n\nThe virtues and vices of public-private partnerships\n\nPolicy implementation\n\n \n\nPresenting a clear overview of how the state operates when government sets out to deliver public services, and generating questions to encourage new research, State Management is a valuable new text for both undergraduate and postgraduate courses in political science, public administration and public management.",

            "description": "* Financial Times Business Book of the Month * Next Big Idea Club Nominee *\n\nA groundbreaking exploration of why we want what we want, and a toolkit for freeing ourselves from chasing unfulfilling desires.\n\nGravity affects every aspect of our physical being, but there's a psychological force just as powerful--yet almost nobody has heard of it. It's responsible for bringing groups of people together and pulling them apart, making certain goals attractive to some and not to others, and fueling cycles of anxiety and conflict. In Wanting, Luke Burgis draws on the work of French polymath René Girard to bring this hidden force to light and reveals how it shapes our lives and societies.\n\nAccording to Girard, humans don't desire anything independently. Human desire is mimetic--we imitate what other people want. This affects the way we choose partners, friends, careers, clothes, and vacation destinations. Mimetic desire is responsible for the formation of our very identities. It explains the enduring relevancy of Shakespeare's plays, why Peter Thiel decided to be the first investor in Facebook, and why our world is growing more divided as it becomes more connected.\n\nWanting also shows that conflict does not arise because of our differences--it comes from our sameness. Because we learn to want what other people want, we often end up competing for the same things. Ignoring our large similarities, we cling to our perceived differences.\n\nDrawing on his experience as an entrepreneur, teacher, and student of classical philosophy and theology, Burgis shares tactics that help turn blind wanting into intentional wanting--not by trying to rid ourselves of desire, but by desiring differently. It's possible to be more in control of the things we want, to achieve more independence from trends and bubbles, and to find more meaning in our work and lives.\n\nThe future will be shaped by our desires. Wanting shows us how to desire a better one.\n\n\nAbout the Author: LUKE BURGIS has founded and led multiple companies.

            "description": "This book is the first to provide an integrated overview of the field, including the concept of digital libraries; transition of libraries from traditional to digital; design and organization of digital libraries; and their architecture, interoperability, protocols, and standards. The term \"digital libraries\" covers the creation and distribution of all types of information over networks, ranging from converted historical materials to kinds of information that have no analogues in the physical world. In some ways digital libraries and traditional libraries are very different, yet in other ways they are remarkably similar. People still create information that has to be organized, stored, and distributed, and they still need to find and use information that others have created. An underlying theme of this book is that no aspect of digital libraries can be understood in isolation or without attention to the needs of the people who create and use information. Although the book covers a wide range of organization, management, files, and formats, the focus is on the actual working components of a digital library, which is open source software for digital libraries: GSDL - DSpace - EPrints. The technological interoperability of digital libraries must be rethought in order to adapt to new uses and networks. Informative digital environments aimed at responding to heritage, cultural, scientific, or commercial demands have taken over the global cyberspace and have redesigned the techno-informative landscape of the Web. However, while the technological models demonstrate their effectiveness and explain to a large extent the creation of digital libraries, archives, and deposits, the subjacent concept of uses continues to cause debate. The information technologies used by heterogeneous digital libraries enable a technical interoperability of content.

            "description": "This second edition of Development Economics: Theory and Practice continues to provide students and practitioners with the perspectives and tools they need to think analytically and critically about the current major economic development issues in the world.\n\nAlain de Janvry and Elisabeth Sadoulet identify seven key dimensions of development--growth, poverty, vulnerability, inequality, basic needs, sustainability, and quality of life--and use them to structure the contents of the text. The book gives a historical perspective on the evolution of thought in development. It uses theory and empirical analysis to present readers with a full picture of how development works, how its successes and failures can be assessed, and how alternatives can be introduced. The authors demonstrate how diagnostics, design of programs and policies, and impact evaluation can be used to seek new solutions to the suffering and violence caused by development failures.\n\nIn the second edition, more attention has been given to ongoing developments, such as:\n\npursuit of the Sustainable Development Goals\n\ncontinuously rising global and national inequality\n\nhealth as a domestic and international public good\n\ncash transfers for social protection\n\ncarbon trading for sustainability\n\nThis text is fully engaged with the most cutting-edge research in the field and equips readers with analytical tools for impact evaluation of development programs and policies, illustrated with numerous examples. It is underpinned throughout by a wealth of student-friendly features, including case studies, quantitative problem sets, end-of-chapter questions, and extensive references. Excel and Stata exercises are available as digital supplements for students and instructors.\n\nThis unique text is ideal for those taking courses in development economics, economic growth, and development policy, and will provide an excellent foundation for those wishing to pursue careers in development.\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nAlain de Janvry is Professor at the Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics and the Goldman School of Public Policy, University of California, Berkeley, USA.\n\nElisabeth Sadoulet is Professor at the Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics, University of California, Berkeley, USA.",

The main objectives of this book are to give the current status of online library services of universities in the world; to give an overview of analysis of the web based library services; the best practices and technology used by these libraries; to promote web presence and web-based services in university libraries; to correlate the rankings of world university with their library rankings, which has not been done earlier; to improve developing countries libraries and to suggest the best practices to be followed by university libraries from developing countries to change their profiles into more modern information centres with higher education potential. This book can be used as a guide to web-based services and best practices top world university libraries are offering. These web-based services are classified in four clusters depending on their scope and type as follows 1. Web-based Bibliographical Services, 2. Web-based Patron Education Services, 3. Web-based Patron Communication Services, and 4. Web-based Publishing Platform for patrons. The details of library web-based best practices offered by top world universities are also covered. Library web-based services and best practices are explained in this book with a good number of examples and screenshots which will help the library professionals to understand and implement these services in their libraries very easily and effectively.

Futura-isms is a collection of essential quotations from this fascinating artist. Gathered from four decades of interviews and panel discussions, this memorable selection illuminates Futura's thoughts on legal and illegal art, his influences, fellow artists, and the past, present, and future. He also offers colorful memories of his adventurous life--growing up in New York City, serving in the Navy, touring with The Clash--and reflects on how his experiences have shaped his art.\n\nSelect quotations from the book:\n\n\"Graffiti was a way for me to exist. I wanted the world to know my name. I wanted to be somebody.\"\n\"The essence of what graffiti is . . . is creating this identity and taking it to the public.\"\n\"My whole life, I think, I've been a nomad.\"\n\"I was always at home in the subway system.\"\n\"People say, 'Let's play within the rules.' I say, 'No--let's break the rules a little bit.'\"\n\nAbout the Author: Futura, born Leonard McGurr, is a renowned artist--a graffiti pioneer, clothing designer, and graphic designer whose work has been shown at museums around the world, including MoMA PS1, the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, and the Groninger Museum.

            "description": "If you think art history has to be pale, male and stale - think again.\nShould museums be made to give back their marbles? Is it even possible to 'decolonise' our galleries? Must Rhodes fall?\n\nFrom the stolen Wakandan art in Black Panther, to Emmanuel Macron's recent commitment to art restitution, and Beyoncé and Jay Z's provocative music video filmed in the Louvre, the question of decolonising our relationship with the art around us is quickly gaining traction. People are waking up to the seedy history of the world's art collections, and are starting to ask difficult questions about what the future of museums should look like.\n\nIn The Whole Picture, art historian and Uncomfortable Art Tour guide Alice Procter provides a manual for deconstructing everything you thought you knew about art, and fills in the blanks with the stories that have been left out of the art history canon for centuries.\n\nThe book is divided into four chronological sections, named after four different kinds of art space:\nThe Palace\nThe Classroom\nThe Memorial\nThe Playground\n\nEach section tackles the fascinating and often shocking stories of five different art pieces, including the propaganda painting that the East India Company used to justify its control in India; the Maori mokomokai skulls that were traded and collected by Europeans as 'art objects'; and Kara Walker's controversial contemporary sculpture A Subtlety, which raised questions about 'appropriate' interactions with art. Through these stories, Alice brings out the underlying colonial narrative lurking beneath the art industry today, and suggests different ways of seeing and thinking about art in the modern world.\n\nThe Whole Picture is a much-needed provocation to look more critically at the accepted narratives about art, and rethink and disrupt the way we interact with the museums and galleries that display it.\nAbout the Author: Alice Procter is an historian of material culture based at UCL. She has six years of tourguiding experience at heritage sites and galleries, and curates exhibitions, organises events, makes podcasts and writes things under the umbrella of The Exhibitionist. Alice's academic work concentrates on the intersections of postcolonial art practice and colonial material culture, settler storytelling, the concept of whiteness in the 18th and 19th centuries, the curation of historical trauma, and myths of national identity. She has has recorded material for the Tate's newly updated audio guides showcasing different voices. Alice is Australian but mostly grew up in England.",

            "description": "A comprehensive account of Shambhala according to the Jonang school of Tibetan Buddhism.\n\nThe Realm of Shambhala presents the Kalachakra Tantra's multilayered approach to Shambhala as taught by the Tibetan Buddhist Jonang tradition. Understood to be an ancient kingdom and physical place, Shambhala is also taught to be an exalted state of mind attainable through spiritual practices. Through cultivating peace and extending it into harmonious relationships with others, the transformative power of Shambhala can enter everyday life. This book provides a concise history and analysis of the term Shambhala as received in the Western world and provides a new interpretation of much-debated scriptural passages. It then details the tradition's perspective on the origins of Kalachakra literature and includes extensive lineage narratives of Jonang masters who have upheld this tradition in India and Tibet.\n\nKhentrul Rinpoche provides a thorough explanation of Shambhala that joins practical teachings with a cosmic vision for humanity rooted in ancient prophecy. The Kalachakra Tantra foresees a golden age of love and compassion, when the individual peace attained through Kalachakra practice spreads to humankind as a whole. The Realm of Shambhala lays out a vision for how we can cultivate an unbiased mind, overcome our collective afflictions, and usher in an era of perfect peace and harmony.\nAbout the Author: SHAR KHENTRUL JAMPHEL LODRÖ was born and raised in Tibet. He has spent over thirty years studying with a wide array of masters from all the major traditions of Tibetan Buddhism and considers his approach to Tibetan Buddhism to be nonsectarian. While having developed a deep respect for all spiritual traditions, for his personal path, he chose to specialize in the Kalachakra teachings.\n\nKhentrul Rinpoche has authored several books that detail the complete Buddhist path of Kalachakra. Based in Melbourne, Australia, Rinpoche dedicates his time to teaching students from around the globe.",

An influential pastor shares how despair can lead us to discover true hope and a deeper relationship with God, helping us emerge stronger and more joyful from times of crisis.\n\n\"May this careful look at pain in the context of Jesus's life open up avenues of discovery and healing.\"--Mindy Caliguire, cofounder and president of Soul Care\n\nWe all experience difficulties and hardships. But how can we learn to live richly in the midst of them? And even grow spiritually because of them? The answer is found in the hopeful humanity of Jesus.\n\nAs the Son of God, Jesus wasn't exempt from suffering, disappointment, or injustice. He lived in the real world as a real person. He wept for those he loved. He felt hunger and thirst. He endured temptation, betrayal, and ridicule. He died after being unjustly tortured. And somehow through it all, he embodied hope--by defeating death and opening a new world of life for us.\n\nIn Echoing Hope, influential pastor and blogger Kurt Willems reveals how understanding the humanity of Jesus can radically transform our identity and empower us to step into our pain-filled world in a new way. Combining rich theological insight with personal stories and practices for response, he shows how we can overcome despair and encounter the beautiful potential of our lives.\nAbout the Author: Kurt Willems is a pastor, church planter, and writer.

            "description": "A remarkable and accessible new translation of the Gospels, destined to become a definitive edition of these canonical texts, from one of today's most respected translators of ancient literature\n\nNAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY PUBLISHERS WEEKLY - \"Electrifying . . . [Ruden transforms] these most familiar of ancient texts into fresh reading experiences.\"--The Christian Science Monitor\n\nFor millennia, the first four books of the New Testament have not only supported the central tenets of Christianity but have also proved to be formative texts for the modern Western world.\n\nThe Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John tell of the life and ministry of Jesus Christ--but they are perhaps best understood as four separate versions of the same story, showing complex origins, intricate interweavings, and often inherent contradictions.\n\nFaithfully pointing the reader back to the original Greek, this masterful new translation from the renowned scholar and acclaimed translator Sarah Ruden is the first to reconsider the Gospels as books to be read and understood on their own terms.\n\nMediating between the authors of the Gospels and present-day readers with unprecedented precision and sensitivity, Ruden gives us the most accessible version of the text available to date. Illuminating footnotes and a discursive glossary explain new word choices and phrasings, and present the Gospels as they originally were: grounded in contemporary languages, literatures, and cultures, full of their own particular drama, humor, and reasoning, and free from later superimposed ideologies.\n\nThe result is a striking and persuasive reappraisal of the accounts of these four evangelists, and presents a new appreciation of the ancient world as the foundation of our modern one. This robust and eminently readable translation is a welcoming ground on which a variety of readers can meet, and a resource for new debate, discussion, and inspiration for years to come.\nAbout the Author: Sarah Ruden was educated at the University of Michigan, Harvard, and Johns Hopkins. She has translated a number of ancient literary works, among them Vergil's Aeneid and Augustine's Confessions, and is the author of Paul Among the People: The Apostle Reinterpreted and Reimagined in His Own Time and The Face of Water: A Translator on Beauty and Meaning in the Bible. She is a past recipient of Guggenheim and Whiting awards, and completed the Gospels translation with the help of a grant from the Robert B. Silvers Foundation.

Due to this, many scholars have written treatises and even books on its rulings and merits. It is also for that reason that Qāḍī 'Iyāḍ devoted to it a section of his celebrated work, al-Shifā'. While the section is short, it provides a valuable entry into such literature, distilling rules and benefits for the seeker in brief expressions and beneficial narrations. We selected this section for quick study and review, which will serve both the busy student and the working professional on the go.\n\n\n\n\nAl-Shifā bi Taʿrīf Ḥuqūq al-Muṣṭafā, directly translated as, 'The Remedy (or Cure) Through Recognizing the Rights of the Chosen One', is one of the most celebrated works in the genre of Shamā'il. It stands uniquely amongst the works of Qāḍī ʿIyād as his most celebrated effort with many surviving manuscripts and commentaries found throughout the Islamic world. Shamā'il is a genre of works that deals with the life, characteristics, and descriptions of the Prophet ﷺ and his station.\n\n\n\n\nAl-Shifā, as it is called for short, stands alone as perhaps the most thorough work in this genre, dealing with both the descriptions of the Prophet ﷺ, his station and his perfections, and with the rulings pertaining to one's belief and treatment of him ﷺ. It is exhaustive in its treatment of the subject, expounding on topics that range from Allah's praise of the Prophet ﷺ and his status and station before Him, to the obligation of loving him and what that entails. In short, the uniqueness of this work can be attributed to its holistic coverage of the Messenger ﷺ.",

And yet, as Daniel Simpson reveals in The Truth of Yoga, much of what is said about yoga is misleading. For example, the word \"yoga\" does not always mean union. In fact, in perhaps the discipline's most famous text-the Yoga Sutra of Patanjali-its aim is described as separation: isolating consciousness from everything else. And yoga is not five thousand years old, as is commonly claimed; the earliest evidence of practice dates back about twenty-five hundred years. (Yoga may well be older, but no one can prove it.)\n\n\n\n\nThe Truth of Yoga is a clear, concise, and accessible handbook for the lay reader that draws upon abundant recent scholarship. It outlines these new findings with practitioners in mind, highlighting ways to keep traditions alive in the twenty-first century.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author: Daniel Simpson teaches at the Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies, in teacher trainings around the UK, and at Triyoga in London.

            "description": "Martin Stevens explores the extraordinary variety of senses in the animal kingdom, and discusses the cutting-edge science that is shedding light on these secret worlds.\n\nOur senses of vision, smell, taste, hearing, and touch are essential for us to respond to threats, communicate and interact with the world around us. This is true for all animals - their sensory systems are key to survival, and without them animals would be completely helpless. However, the sensory\nsystems of other animals work very differently from ours. For example, many animals from spiders to birds can detect and respond to ultraviolet light, to which we are blind. Other animals, including many insects, rodents, and bats can hear high-frequency ultrasonic sounds well beyond our own hearing\nrange. Many other species have sensory systems that we lack completely, such as the magnetic sense of birds, turtles, and other animals, or the electric sense of many fish. These differences in sensory ability have a major bearing on the ways that animals behave and live in different environments,\nand also affect their evolution and ecology.\n\nIn this book, Martin Stevens explores the remarkable sensory systems that exist in nature, and what they are used for. Discussing how different animal senses work, he also considers how they evolve, how they are shaped by the environment in which an animal lives, and the pioneering science that has\nuncovered how animals use their senses. Throughout, he celebrates the remarkable diversity of life, and shows how the study of sensory systems has shed light on some of the most important issues in animal behaviour, physiology, and evolution.\n\nAbout the Author:\nMartin Stevens is Professor of Sensory and Evolutionary Ecology at the University of Exeter. His research has covered a wide range of areas, but much of his current work explores how animals change colour for camouflage, and how human impacts on the environment are affecting animal coloration and\nvision. He has authored over 120 scientific papers, two textbooks, and a popular science book on deception in nature Cheats and Deceits, (Oxford University Press, 2016). Stevens' work is frequently covered in the popular media, including by the New Scientist and the New York Times. He has appeared\nseveral times on radio and TV, such as on the BBC and on National Geographic, and has given a range of public lectures around the world.\n",

Addressing the students of mathematics and physics and researchers interested in operator algebras, noncommutative geometry and free probability, this revised edition covers the fundamentals and latest developments in the field of operator algebras. It discusses the group-measure space construction, Krieger factors, infinite tensor products of factors of type I (ITPFI factors) and construction of the type III_1 hyperfinite factor. It also studies the techniques necessary for continuous and discrete decomposition, duality theory for noncommutative groups, discrete decomposition of Connes, and Ocneanu's result on the actions of amenable groups. It contains a detailed consideration of groups of automorphisms and their spectral theory, and the theory of crossed products.",

Maharaja Gaj Singhji, of Jodhpur-Marwar transformed the Rathore's magnificent Mehrangarh Fort into a highly successful Rajput museum and cultural center. As part of this work, the Mehrangarh Museum Trust commissioned this book. The author discusses the worldwide medieval diffusion of firearms technology and Arab, Ottoman, European and Chinese influences on the development of Indian firearms. Jodhpur was one of the most important military states in Rajasthan, playing a major role in the history of the subcontinent, never more so than during the reign of Maharaja Ajit Singhji (1678-1724) who purchased large numbers of guns when his daughter married the Mughal emperor. Jodhpur owns the best Indian matchlocks in the subcontinent, much admired at the Delhi Durbar in 1911. Successive maharajas have added to the collection, which includes modern British and American sporting guns, shotguns, revolvers and automatic pistols by many of the great makers of the twentieth century, collected by the Maharaja's grandfather, a noted hunter, and his father, a gun designer. The Maharaja of Jodhpur's Guns is the first book to be written specifically on historic Indian firearms. With more than 350 unique images of guns and Rajput paintings from private collections showing their use, this book offers scholars and collectors the opportunity to see the superb Jodhpur collection and to learn about Rajput traditions relating to hunting and war.\nAbout the Author: Robert Elgood, an expert on the historic arms of Hindu India and the Islamic world, has lectured and worked in many countries.

            "description": "Professional football is the most popular sport in the world in terms of both spectator attendance and television viewing figures. As its popularity has grown so has its monetary value. Kieran Maguire looks at the different ways in which professional football operates as a business - how clubs make their money, or more commonly, lose it. In particular he analyses how success is measured by the different and often competing stakeholders in football clubs - owners, managers, fans, players, commercial partners and the media. Throughout, he draws on a range of case studies using the finances of professional clubs in the UK and overseas to show how the traditional profit based approach of limited companies applies to football.\n\nThe book begins by interrogating the balance sheet, income statement and cash flow statement of the football club and explains how assets are financed and how clubs account for players in different ways. The supply and demand of players and managers is examined, including the reasons for the rise in wage levels at the elite end and how clubs account for player acquisitions, disposals, contract extensions and loans. How clubs are traded, why they are bought and sold, and how they are valued is contrasted with other businesses. The rich variety of ownership models is explored, from the overseas government wealth fund (Manchester City), the wealthy individual's vanity project (Chelsea, Newcastle) to the brand extension of private companies (Bayer Leverkuesen) and the cooperative ownership model championed by Barcelona. How ticket prices, the benefits and costs of television rights and the success or otherwise of brand monetization impact on the finances of clubs are all explained as well as the main causes of financial distress and why some clubs may be too big to fail.\n\nAt a time when many commentators are bemoaning the effects of \"too much money\" in the game, this clear-headed and rigorous analysis and presentation of the financial imperatives and challenges facing football will be welcomed not only by students of the industry, but by the wider consituency of fans and supporters.\nAbout the Author: Kieran Maguire is senior teacher in accounting and finance at the University of Liverpool Management School, where he teaches the Football Industries MBA.

            "authorName": "Ivan Butler",
            "description": "Liverpool Matches of My Lifetime provides a unique perspective on 50 iconic Liverpool games spanning the author's lifetime, from 1960 to date. It takes the reader on a journey through 60 years of this famous club, from its Second Division days to the recent victory in the FIFA Club World Cup and many trophy-winning successes in between. Beginning with a brief history of the club up to 1959, the author relives 50 crucial games that brought Liverpool to the pinnacle of club football by 2019. All the chosen matches meant a great deal to the club, its fans and the author. Along the way there are many firsts, record victories, trophies and games that have gone down in Anfield folklore. As well as covering iconic matches, the book provides brief profiles of key players and tells the story of the intervening years, with all the highs and lows that Liverpool experienced in search of that elusive Premier League title. Are Liverpool the greatest English team of the last 60 years? Judge for yourself as you read the story of this wonderful club.\nAbout the Author: Liverpool Matches of My Lifetime is Ivan Butler's first book after spending the last few years editing and proofreading the work of other authors. After proofreading several books for Pitch Publishing, and having a passion for most sports, particularly football, he realised that no one had written a book on Liverpool FC for Pitch's 'Greatest Games' series. So he decided to venture into writing to see what life is like on the other side.",

Why does almost nobody look even marginally athletic?\n\n\n\n\nFitness may be the most failed human endeavor, and you are about to see how exercise science has missed some obvious principles that when enacted will turn you into the superhuman you always wanted to be.\n\n﻿\n\nIn Weight Lifting is a Waste of Time, Dr. John Jaquish and Henry Alkire explore the science that supports this argument and lay out a superior strength training approach that has been seen to put 20 pounds of muscle on drug-free, experienced lifters (i.e., not beginners) in six months.",

But Lee was also a deeply philosophical thinker, learning at an early age that martial arts are more than just an exercise in physical discipline--they are an apt metaphor for living a fully realized life.\n\nNow, in Be Water, My Friend, Lee's daughter Shannon shares the concepts at the core of his philosophies, showing how they can serve as tools of personal growth and self-actualization. Each chapter brings a lesson from Bruce Lee's teachings, expanding on the foundation of his iconic \"be water\" philosophy. Over the course of the book, we discover how being like water allows us to embody fluidity and naturalness in life, bringing us closer to our essential flowing nature and our ability to be powerful, self-expressed, and free.\n\nThrough previously untold stories from her father's life and from her own journey in embodying these lessons, Shannon presents these philosophies in tangible, accessible ways. With Bruce Lee's words as a guide, she encourages readers to pursue their essential selves and apply these ideas and practices to their everyday lives--whether in learning new things, overcoming obstacles, or ultimately finding their true path.\n\nBe Water, My Friend is an inspirational invitation to us all, a gentle call to action to consider our lives with new eyes. It is also a testament to how one man's exploration and determination transcended time and place to ignite our imaginations--and to inspire many around the world to transform their lives.\n\n\nAbout the Author: Shannon Lee is the CEO and Owner of the Bruce Lee Family Companies and President of the Bruce Lee Foundation, as well as the daughter of the legendary martial artist and cultural icon, Bruce Lee.

            "authorName": "Asha Chaubey",
            "description": "WASTEWATER TREATMENT TECHNOLOGIES\n\nGlobally, the practice of wastewater treatment before discharge is inconsistent. The United Nations World Water Development Report (2017) estimated that, globally, over 80% of all wastewater is discharged without treatment. The discharge of untreated or inadequately treated wastewater into the environment results in the pollution of surface water, soil and groundwater. According to the WHO, water-related diseases kill around 2.2 million people globally each year, mostly children in developing countries. We need to understand that wastewater is not merely a water management issue - it affects the environment, all living beings, and can have direct impacts on economies.\n\nThe establishment of UN Sustainable Development Goal 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), which aims to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, reflects the increased attention on water and wastewater treatment issues in the global political agenda. Water reuse is one of the most efficient, cost effective and eco-friendly ways to ensure water resilience. Embedding sustainability into wastewater treatment is the best opportunity for industries to drive smarter innovation and efficient wastewater treatment. The modern concept of industrial wastewater treatment is moving away from conventional design. Wastewater treatment technology is moving towards extreme modular design using smart and sustainable technology.\n\nThis book is intended as a reference book for all wastewater treatment professionals and operational personnel. It may also be used as a textbook on graduate and postgraduate courses in the field of wastewater treatment and management. The book takes a holistic view of the practical problems faced by industry and provides multiple needs-based solutions to tackle wastewater treatment and management issues. It elaborates on selection of technology and their design criteria for different types of wastewater. This will enable engineering students and professionals to expand their horizons in the fields of wastewater treatment and management.\nAbout the Author:\n\nDr Mritunjay Chaubey is a wastewater treatment, environmental and sustainability expert of international repute. He has a PhD in environmental engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi. Dr Chaubey is also an Editorial Board member of the renowned international journals Research Journal of Chemistry and Environment, Arab Water World, and Environmental Science Journal, and has authored or co-authored more than 50 technical papers.

            "description": "Revised and updated in its fifth edition, this internationally renowned and respected book provides the essentials to understanding all areas of airline finance. Designed to address each of the distinct areas of financial management in an air transport industry context, it also shows how these fit together, while each chapter and topic - for example, aircraft leasing - provides a detailed resource that can also be consulted separately.\n\nSupported at each stage by practical airline examples and recent data, Airline Finance examines the financial trends and longer term prospects for the airline industry as a whole, contrasting the developments for the major regions and airlines together with critical discussion of key issues that affect the industry as a whole. Important techniques in financial analysis are applied to the airlines as well as their investors such as banks and other financial institutions.\n\nThoroughly amended and updated throughout, and expanded with the addition of two new chapters, the fifth edition reflects the many developments that have affected the industry, such as the impacts of the banking and sovereign debt crises on the airline industry, signs of re-nationalisation of airlines that have emerged in Europe, and the substantial changes that have occurred in connection with rating agencies and LIBOR. New start-ups and bankruptcies are covered for the first time in a new chapter, joined by airline mergers and acquisitions (M&A), both playing a role in airline concentration. Reflecting their status as a permanent feature, fuel hedging and fuel surcharges now also have their own chapter. The medium- to long-term future in terms of further concentration and government intervention (or the lack of it) and a shift in aircraft financing towards capital markets are discussed in the final chapter.\n\nThe book is written for employees of airlines, airports and their suppliers, and investment bank and other analysts. It is also popular for use by universities and in-house courses on air transport management, within both academia and industry.\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nPeter S. Morrell graduated in economics from Cambridge University and subsequently gained a master's degree in air transportation from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he worked on NASA-sponsored research into airline forecasting and profitability. He has a doctorate in airline capital productivity from Cranfield University. He initially worked with merchant bank Lazard Brothers, in the City, before joining the Association of European Airlines in Brussels as an economist in 1971. He worked as an air transport consultant from 1978 to 1991, when he joined Cranfield's Department of Air Transport, retiring in 2011.\n\nHe is a former head of the Department of Air Transport at Cranfield University, where he had a chair in air transport economics and finance. He is now an independent aviation advisor and a visiting professor at Cranfield University, and is on the editorial board of the Journal of Air Transport Management and Tourism Economics. He is the author of Airline Finance (the fifth edition of which will be published in 2021, and a Chinese edition in 2007), Moving Boxes by Air: The Economics of International Air Cargo, second edition with Thomas Klein (2018), and has written many papers for both academic and industry journals.",

So begins the written and photographic journey through four African countries tracking wild animals through tall grasses and thorny bushes, sleeping with hippos grunting outside thin bedroom walls, facing down an elephant, and watching as my husband almost loses his life for a hot breakfast. Gliding down the Okavango Delta takes birding to a higher level. There, I encounter birds light enough to walk on lily pads, others tall enough to look me in the eye. In the Namib Desert, I witness survival and death.In Soweto and Johannesburg, with its gold and saffron colored air, I trace apartheid from its inception to its demise. I savor the kindness of people in rural villages, see the desperation and hope of squatters living in \"informal settlements\" outside cities, and find myself in awe of their courage and ingenuity. In An Elephant at My Door, I share this special world with readers through stories wrapped up in a safari adventure.",

            "description": "\"If you've been looking for something different to level up your health, fitness, and personal growth, this is it.\"--Melissa Urban, Whole30 CEO and New York Times bestselling author\n\nDiscover the evolutionary mind and body benefits of living at the edges of your comfort zone and reconnecting with the wild.\n\nIn many ways, we're more comfortable than ever before. But could our sheltered, temperature-controlled, overfed, underchallenged lives actually be the leading cause of many our most urgent physical and mental health issues? In this gripping investigation, award-winning journalist Michael Easter seeks out off-the-grid visionaries, disruptive genius researchers, and mind-body conditioning trailblazers who are unlocking the life-enhancing secrets of a counterintuitive solution: discomfort.\n\nEaster's journey to understand our evolutionary need to be challenged takes him to meet the NBA's top exercise scientist, who uses an ancient Japanese practice to build championship athletes; to the mystical country of Bhutan, where an Oxford economist and Buddhist leader are showing the world what death can teach us about happiness; to the outdoor lab of a young neuroscientist who's found that nature tests our physical and mental endurance in ways that expand creativity while taming burnout and anxiety; to the remote Alaskan backcountry on a demanding thirty-three-day hunting expedition to experience the rewilding secrets of one of the last rugged places on Earth; and more.\n\nAlong the way, Easter uncovers a blueprint for leveraging the power of discomfort that will dramatically improve our health and happiness, and perhaps even help us understand what it means to be human. The Comfort Crisis is a bold call to break out of your comfort zone and explore the wild within yourself.\nAbout the Author: Michael Easter is a contributing editor at Men's Health magazine, columnist for Outside magazine, and professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.

            "description": "- A voyage through the Buddhist, Hindu and Islamic influences that haveshaped Kashmir's rich cultural history - Features over 120 inspiring images and packed with nuggets of information, such as that the Chinar tree - an integral part of the Kashmiri landscape - was originally brought from Persia - Takes the reader on a fascinating journey through a land that has inspired poets and emperors, writers and explorers, through the ages Kashmir: A Journey Through History will appeal to the armchair traveler and history buff. Neither an academic tome nor a guidebook, it describes how Kashmir - ringed by snow-capped peaks - has attracted pilgrims and Sufis, armies and traders, travelers and adventurers, over the centuries, who embraced the crisp mountain air, a world away from the soaring heat of the Indian plains. Weare creates engaging story lines that capture the passage of Buddhist, Hindu and Islamic influences which have shaped Kashmir's rich cultural history. The book traces the journey of the region from its ancient times to the present, with chapters highlighting periods in history, such as the role of the Mughal Emperors who created over 700 resplendent gardens and patronized the fine pashmina shawls that were to grace the palaces of India and Europe. The Treaty of Amritsar signed by the British East India Company and Maharaja Gulab Singh of Jammu, in 1846, created the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir - a state forged more through political ambition than cultural design. It was a time when Kashmir became part of the Great Game, where intrepid British explorers kept a watchful eye on the state's borders. In October 1947 Kashmir's political future came to a head when Maharaja Hari Singh signed the Instrument of Accession to India. Since then Kashmir has been subject to decades of instability along with years battling insurgency as it continues on its long walk to normalcy. Featuring over 120 inspiring images and packed with nuggets of information, Kashmir: A Journey Through History takes the reader on a fascinating voyage through a land that has inspired poets and emperors, writers and explorers, through the ages.\nAbout the Author: Garry Weare has had a long-standing relationship with the Himalaya since leading his first trek in Kashmir in 1973. For 13 years Weare had an enviable lifestyle organizing and leading treks from the comfort of his houseboat in Kashmir. Following the outbreak of political unrest in Kashmir in 1990 Weare continued to return regularly to Kashmir and other regions of the Indian Himalaya, leading exploratory treks or researching his Trekking in the Indian Himalaya guide published by Lonely Planet. He also wrote his acclaimed A Long Walk in the Himalaya, an account of an epic five-month trek from the source of the Ganges to Kashmir. Weare is the Australian Secretary for the Himalayan Club, a fellow of the Royal Geographic Society and has been awarded for his outstanding contribution for promoting adventure travel in the Indian Himalaya. Weare is also a founding director of the Australian Himalayan Foundation. He has a daughter and two stepdaughters and lives with his wife Margie Thomas in the Southern Highlands, NSW, Australia.
